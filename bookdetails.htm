Bilkson (in small letters), from \r\nCollard and Collard (in very large letters).&nbsp; It is also a great comfort to \r\nus to know that our boy Willie is getting on so well in the Bank at \r\nOldham.&nbsp; We should like to see more of him.&nbsp; Now for my diary:—</P>\r\n\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 3<P class=check>Tradesmen called for custom, and I promised \r\nFarmerson, the ironmonger, to give him a turn if I wanted any nails or \r\ntools.&nbsp; By-the-by, that reminds me there is no key to our bedroom door, and \r\nthe bells must be seen to.&nbsp; The parlour bell is broken, and the front door \r\nrings up in the servant’s bedroom, which is ridiculous.&nbsp; Dear friend Gowing \r\ndropped in, but wouldn’t stay, saying there was an infernal smell of paint.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=80% src="1_2.gif"><br>Our dear friend Gowing.</P>\r\n\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 4<P class=check>Tradesmen still calling; Carrie being \r\nout, I arranged to deal with Horwin, who seemed a civil butcher with a nice \r\nclean shop.&nbsp; Ordered a shoulder of mutton for to-morrow, to give him a \r\ntrial.&nbsp; Carrie arranged with Borset, the butterman, and ordered a pound of \r\nfresh butter, and a pound and a half of salt ditto for kitchen, and a shilling’s \r\nworth of eggs.&nbsp; In the evening, Cummings unexpectedly dropped in to show me \r\na meerschaum pipe he had won in a raffle in the City, and told me to handle it \r\ncarefully, as it would spoil the colouring if the hand was moist.&nbsp; He said \r\nhe wouldn’t stay, as he didn’t care much for the smell of the paint, and fell \r\nover the scraper as he went out.&nbsp; Must get the scraper removed, or else I \r\nshall get into a <I>scrape</I>.&nbsp; I don’t often make jokes.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=80% src="1_3.gif"><br>Our dear friend Cummings.</P>\r\n\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 5<P class=check>Two shoulders of mutton arrived, Carrie \r\nhaving arranged with another butcher without consulting me.&nbsp; Gowing called, \r\nand fell over scraper coming in.&nbsp; <I>Must</I> get that scraper removed.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 6<P class=check>Eggs for breakfast simply shocking; sent \r\nthem back to Borset with my compliments, and he needn’t call any more for \r\norders.&nbsp; Couldn’t find umbrella, and though it was pouring with rain, had \r\nto go without it.&nbsp; Sarah said Mr. Gowing must have took it by mistake last \r\nnight, as there was a stick in the ‘all that didn’t belong to nobody.&nbsp; In \r\nthe evening, hearing someone talking in a loud voice to the servant in the \r\ndownstairs hall, I went out to see who it was, and was surprised to find it was \r\nBorset, the butterman, who was both drunk and offensive.&nbsp; Borset, on seeing \r\nme, said he would be hanged if he would ever serve City clerks any more—the game \r\nwasn’t worth the candle.&nbsp; I restrained my feelings, and quietly remarked \r\nthat I thought it was <I>possible</I> for a city clerk to be a \r\n<I>gentleman</I>.&nbsp; He replied he was very glad to hear it, and wanted to \r\nknow whether I had ever come across one, for <I>he</I> hadn’t.&nbsp; He left the \r\nhouse, slamming the door after him, which nearly broke the fanlight; and I heard \r\nhim fall over the scraper, which made me feel glad I hadn’t removed it.&nbsp; \r\nWhen he had gone, I thought of a splendid answer I ought to have given \r\nhim.&nbsp; However, I will keep it for another occasion.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 7<P class=check>Being Saturday, I looked forward to being \r\nhome early, and putting a few things straight; but two of our principals at the \r\noffice were absent through illness, and I did not get home till seven.&nbsp; \r\nFound Borset waiting.&nbsp; He had been three times during the day to apologise \r\nfor his conduct last night.&nbsp; He said he was unable to take his Bank Holiday \r\nlast Monday, and took it last night instead.&nbsp; He begged me to accept his \r\napology, and a pound of fresh butter.&nbsp; He seems, after all, a decent sort \r\nof fellow; so I gave him an order for some fresh eggs, with a request that on \r\nthis occasion they <I>should</I> be fresh.&nbsp; I am afraid we shall have to \r\nget some new stair-carpets after all; our old ones are not quite wide enough to \r\nmeet the paint on either side.&nbsp; Carrie suggests that we might ourselves \r\nbroaden the paint.&nbsp; I will see if we can match the colour (dark chocolate) \r\non Monday.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 8<br>Sunday<P class=check>After Church, the Curate came back \r\nwith us.&nbsp; I sent Carrie in to open the front door, which we do not use except \r\non special occasions.&nbsp; She could not get it open, and after all my display, \r\nI had to take the Curate (whose name, by-the-by, I did not catch,) round the \r\nside entrance.&nbsp; He caught his foot in the scraper, and tore the bottom of \r\nhis trousers.&nbsp; Most annoying, as Carrie could not well offer to repair them \r\non a Sunday.&nbsp; After dinner, went to sleep.&nbsp; Took a walk round the \r\ngarden, and discovered a beautiful spot for sowing mustard-and-cress and \r\nradishes.&nbsp; Went to Church again in the evening: walked back with the \r\nCurate.&nbsp; Carrie noticed he had got on the same pair of trousers, only \r\nrepaired.&nbsp; He wants me to take round the plate, which I think a great \r\ncompliment.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter II</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Tradesmen and the scraper still troublesome.&nbsp; Gowing rather tiresome with his complaints of the paint.&nbsp; I make one of the best jokes of my life.&nbsp; Delights of Gardening.&nbsp; Mr. Stillbrook, Gowing, Cummings, and I have a little misunderstanding.&nbsp; Sarah makes me look a fool before Cummings.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 9<P class=check>Commenced the morning badly.&nbsp; The \r\nbutcher, whom we decided <I>not</I> to arrange with, called and blackguarded me \r\nin the most uncalled-for manner.&nbsp; He began by abusing me, and saying he did \r\nnot want my custom.&nbsp; I simply said: “Then what are you making all this fuss \r\nabout it for?”&nbsp; And he shouted out at the top of his voice, so that all the \r\nneighbours could hear: “Pah! go along.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; I could buy up ‘things’ \r\nlike you by the dozen!”</P>\r\n<P>I shut the door, and was giving Carrie to understand that this disgraceful \r\nscene was entirely her fault, when there was a violent kicking at the door, \r\nenough to break the panels.&nbsp; It was the blackguard butcher again, who said \r\nhe had cut his foot over the scraper, and would immediately bring an action \r\nagainst me.&nbsp; Called at Farmerson’s, the ironmonger, on my way to town, and \r\ngave him the job of moving the scraper and repairing the bells, thinking it \r\nscarcely worth while to trouble the landlord with such a trifling matter.</P>\r\n<P>Arrived home tired and worried.&nbsp; Mr. Putley, a painter and decorator, \r\nwho had sent in a card, said he could not match the colour on the stairs, as it \r\ncontained Indian carmine.&nbsp; He said he spent half-a-day calling at \r\nwarehouses to see if he could get it.&nbsp; He suggested he should entirely \r\nrepaint the stairs.&nbsp; It would cost very little more; if he tried to match \r\nit, he could only make a bad job of it.&nbsp; It would be more satisfactory to \r\nhim and to us to have the work done properly.&nbsp; I consented, but felt I had \r\nbeen talked over.&nbsp; Planted some mustard-and-cress and radishes, and went to \r\nbed at nine.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 10<P class=check>Farmerson came round to attend to the \r\nscraper himself.&nbsp; He seems a very civil fellow.&nbsp; He says he does not \r\nusually conduct such small jobs personally, but for me he would do so.&nbsp; I \r\nthanked him, and went to town.&nbsp; It is disgraceful how late some of the \r\nyoung clerks are at arriving.&nbsp; I told three of them that if Mr. Perkupp, \r\nthe principal, heard of it, they might be discharged.</P>\r\n<P>Pitt, a monkey of seventeen, who has only been with us six weeks, told me “to \r\nkeep my hair on!”&nbsp; I informed him I had had the honour of being in the firm \r\ntwenty years, to which he insolently replied that I “looked it.”&nbsp; I gave \r\nhim an indignant look, and said: “I demand from you some respect, sir.”&nbsp; He \r\nreplied: “All right, go on demanding.”&nbsp; I would not argue with him any \r\nfurther.&nbsp; You cannot argue with people like that.&nbsp; In the evening \r\nGowing called, and repeated his complaint about the smell of paint.&nbsp; Gowing \r\nis sometimes very tedious with his remarks, and not always cautious; and Carrie \r\nonce very properly reminded him that she was present.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 11<P class=check>Mustard-and-cress and radishes not come up \r\nyet.&nbsp; To-day was a day of annoyances.&nbsp; I missed the quarter-to-nine \r\n’bus to the City, through having words with the grocer’s boy, who for the second \r\ntime had the impertinence to bring his basket to the hall-door, and had left the \r\nmarks of his dirty boots on the fresh-cleaned door-steps.&nbsp; He said he had \r\nknocked at the side door with his knuckles for a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; I \r\nknew Sarah, our servant, could not hear this, as she was upstairs doing the \r\nbedrooms, so asked the boy why he did not ring the bell?&nbsp; He replied that \r\nhe did pull the bell, but the handle came off in his hand.</P>\r\n<P>I was half-an-hour late at the office, a thing that has never happened to me \r\nbefore.&nbsp; There has recently been much irregularity in the attendance of the \r\nclerks, and Mr. Perkupp, our principal, unfortunately choose this very morning \r\nto pounce down upon us early.&nbsp; Someone had given the tip to the \r\nothers.&nbsp; The result was that I was the only one late of the lot.&nbsp; \r\nBuckling, one of the senior clerks, was a brick, and I was saved by his \r\nintervention.&nbsp; As I passed by Pitt’s desk, I heard him remark to his \r\nneighbour: “How disgracefully late some of the head clerks arrive!”&nbsp; This \r\nwas, of course, meant for me.&nbsp; I treated the observation with silence, \r\nsimply giving him a look, which unfortunately had the effect of making both of \r\nthe clerks laugh.&nbsp; Thought afterwards it would have been more dignified if \r\nI had pretended not to have heard him at all.&nbsp; Cummings called in the \r\nevening, and we played dominoes.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 12<P class=check>Mustard-and-cress and radishes not come up \r\nyet.&nbsp; Left Farmerson repairing the scraper, but when I came home found \r\nthree men working.&nbsp; I asked the meaning of it, and Farmerson said that in \r\nmaking a fresh hole he had penetrated the gas-pipe.&nbsp; He said it was a most \r\nridiculous place to put the gas-pipe, and the man who did it evidently knew \r\nnothing about his business.&nbsp; I felt his excuse was no consolation for the \r\nexpense I shall be put to.</P>\r\n<P>In the evening, after tea, Gowing dropped in, and we had a smoke together in \r\nthe breakfast-parlour.&nbsp; Carrie joined us later, but did not stay long, \r\nsaying the smoke was too much for her.&nbsp; It was also rather too much for me, \r\nfor Gowing had given me what he called a green cigar, one that his friend \r\nShoemach had just brought over from America.&nbsp; The cigar didn’t look green, \r\nbut I fancy I must have done so; for when I had smoked a little more than half I \r\nwas obliged to retire on the pretext of telling Sarah to bring in the \r\nglasses.</P>\r\n<P>I took a walk round the garden three or four times, feeling the need of fresh \r\nair.&nbsp; On returning Gowing noticed I was not smoking: offered me another \r\ncigar, which I politely declined.&nbsp; Gowing began his usual sniffing, so, \r\nanticipating him, I said: “You’re not going to complain of the smell of paint \r\nagain?”&nbsp; He said: “No, not this time; but I’ll tell you what, I distinctly \r\nsmell dry rot.”&nbsp; I don’t often make jokes, but I replied: “You’re talking a \r\nlot of <I>dry rot</I> yourself.”&nbsp; I could not help roaring at this, and \r\nCarrie said her sides quite ached with laughter.&nbsp; I never was so immensely \r\ntickled by anything I have ever said before.&nbsp; I actually woke up twice \r\nduring the night, and laughed till the bed shook.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 13<P class=check>An extraordinary coincidence: Carrie had \r\ncalled in a woman to make some chintz covers for our drawing-room chairs and \r\nsofa to prevent the sun fading the green rep of the furniture.&nbsp; I saw the \r\nwoman, and recognised her as a woman who used to work years ago for my old aunt \r\nat Clapham.&nbsp; It only shows how small the world is.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 14<P class=check>Spent the whole of the afternoon in the \r\ngarden, having this morning picked up at a bookstall for fivepence a capital \r\nlittle book, in good condition, on <I>Gardening</I>.&nbsp; I procured and sowed \r\nsome half-hardy annuals in what I fancy will be a warm, sunny border.&nbsp; I \r\nthought of a joke, and called out Carrie.&nbsp; Carrie came out rather testy, I \r\nthought.&nbsp; I said: “I have just discovered we have got a \r\nlodging-house.”&nbsp; She replied: “How do you mean?”&nbsp; I said: “Look at the \r\n<I>boarders</I>.”&nbsp; Carrie said: “Is that all you wanted me for?”&nbsp; I \r\nsaid: “Any other time you would have laughed at my little pleasantry.”&nbsp; \r\nCarrie said: “Certainly—<I>at any other time</I>, but not when I am busy in the \r\nhouse.”&nbsp; The stairs looked very nice.&nbsp; Gowing called, and said the \r\nstairs looked <I>all right</I>, but it made the banisters look <I>all wrong</I>, \r\nand suggested a coat of paint on them also, which Carrie quite agreed \r\nwith.&nbsp; I walked round to Putley, and fortunately he was out, so I had a \r\ngood excuse to let the banisters slide.&nbsp; By-the-by, that is rather \r\nfunny.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 15<br>Sunday<P class=check>At three o’clock Cummings and \r\nGowing called for a good long walk over Hampstead and Finchley, and brought with \r\nthem a friend named Stillbrook.&nbsp; We walked and chatted together, except \r\nStillbrook, who was always a few yards behind us staring at the ground and \r\ncutting at the grass with his stick.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="2_1.gif"><br>Stillbrook lags behind. Going up hill.</P>\r\n\r\n<P>As it was getting on for five, we four held a consultation, and Gowing \r\nsuggested that we should make for “The Cow and Hedge” and get some tea.&nbsp; \r\nStillbrook said: “A brandy-and-soda was good enough for him.”&nbsp; I reminded \r\nthem that all public-houses were closed till six o’clock.&nbsp; Stillbrook said, \r\n“That’s all right—<I>bona-fide</I> travellers.”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="2_2.gif"><br>Going down hill.</P>\r\n\r\n<P>We arrived; and as I was trying to pass, the man in charge of the gate said: \r\n“Where from?”&nbsp; I replied: “Holloway.”&nbsp; He immediately put up his arm, \r\nand declined to let me pass.&nbsp; I turned back for a moment, when I saw \r\nStillbrook, closely followed by Cummings and Gowing, make for the \r\nentrance.&nbsp; I watched them, and thought I would have a good laugh at their \r\nexpense, I heard the porter say: “Where from?”&nbsp; When, to my surprise, in \r\nfact disgust, Stillbrook replied: “Blackheath,” and the three were immediately \r\nadmitted.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="2_3.gif"><br>Nearly there.</P>\r\n\r\n<P>Gowing called to me across the gate, and said: “We shan’t be a minute.”&nbsp; \r\nI waited for them the best part of an hour.&nbsp; When they appeared they were \r\nall in most excellent spirits, and the only one who made an effort to apologise \r\nwas Mr. Stillbrook, who said to me: “It was very rough on you to be kept \r\nwaiting, but we had another spin for S. and B.’s.”&nbsp; I walked home in \r\nsilence; I couldn’t speak to them.&nbsp; I felt very dull all the evening, but \r\ndeemed it advisable <I>not</I> to say anything to Carrie about the matter.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 16<P class=check>After business, set to work in the \r\ngarden.&nbsp; When it got dark I wrote to Cummings and Gowing (who neither \r\ncalled, for a wonder; perhaps they were ashamed of themselves) about yesterday’s \r\nadventure at “The Cow and Hedge.”&nbsp; Afterwards made up my mind not to write \r\n<I>yet</I>.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 17<P class=check>Thought I would write a kind little note \r\nto Gowing and Cummings about last Sunday, and warning them against Mr. \r\nStillbrook.&nbsp; Afterwards, thinking the matter over, tore up the letters and \r\ndetermined not to <I>write</I> at all, but to <I>speak</I> quietly to \r\nthem.&nbsp; Dumfounded at receiving a sharp letter from Cummings, saying that \r\nboth he and Gowing had been waiting for an explanation of <I>my</I> (mind you, \r\n<SPAN class=smcap>my</SPAN>) extraordinary conduct coming home on Sunday.&nbsp; \r\nAt last I wrote: “I thought I was the aggrieved party; but as I freely forgive \r\nyou, you—feeling yourself aggrieved—should bestow forgiveness on me.”&nbsp; I \r\nhave copied this <I>verbatim</I> in the diary, because I think it is one of the \r\nmost perfect and thoughtful sentences I have ever written.&nbsp; I posted the \r\nletter, but in my own heart I felt I was actually apologising for having been \r\ninsulted.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 18<P class=check>Am in for a cold.&nbsp; Spent the whole \r\nday at the office sneezing.&nbsp; In the evening, the cold being intolerable, \r\nsent Sarah out for a bottle of Kinahan.&nbsp; Fell asleep in the arm-chair, and \r\nwoke with the shivers.&nbsp; Was startled by a loud knock at the front \r\ndoor.&nbsp; Carrie awfully flurried.&nbsp; Sarah still out, so went up, opened \r\nthe door, and found it was only Cummings.&nbsp; Remembered the grocer’s boy had \r\nagain broken the side-bell.&nbsp; Cummings squeezed my hand, and said: “I’ve \r\njust seen Gowing.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Say no more about it.”&nbsp; There is \r\nno doubt they are both under the impression I have apologised.</P>\r\n<P>While playing dominoes with Cummings in the parlour, he said: “By-the-by, do \r\nyou want any wine or spirits?&nbsp; My cousin Merton has just set up in the \r\ntrade, and has a splendid whisky, four years in bottle, at thirty-eight \r\nshillings.&nbsp; It is worth your while laying down a few dozen of it.”&nbsp; I \r\ntold him my cellars, which were very small, were full up.&nbsp; To my horror, at \r\nthat very moment, Sarah entered the room, and putting a bottle of whisky, \r\nwrapped in a dirty piece of newspaper, on the table in front of us, said: \r\n“Please, sir, the grocer says he ain’t got no more Kinahan, but you’ll find this \r\nvery good at two-and-six, with twopence returned on the bottle; and, please, did \r\nyou want any more sherry? as he has some at one-and-three, as dry as a nut!”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="2_4.gif"><br>“Please, sir, the grocer says he ain’t got no more Kinahan, but you’ll find this \r\nvery good at two-and-six”</P>\r\n\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter III</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>A conversation with Mr. Merton on Society.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. James, of Sutton, come up.&nbsp; A miserable evening at the Tank Theatre.&nbsp; Experiments with enamel paint.&nbsp; I make another good joke; but Gowing and Cummings are unnecessarily offended.&nbsp; I paint the bath red, with unexpected result.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 19<P class=check>Cummings called, bringing with him his \r\nfriend Merton, who is in the wine trade.&nbsp; Gowing also called.&nbsp; Mr. \r\nMerton made himself at home at once, and Carrie and I were both struck with him \r\nimmediately, and thoroughly approved of his sentiments.</P>\r\n<P>He leaned back in his chair and said: “You must take me as I am;” and I \r\nreplied: “Yes—and you must take us as we are.&nbsp; We’re homely people, we are \r\nnot swells.”</P>\r\n<P>He answered: “No, I can see that,” and Gowing roared with laughter; but \r\nMerton in a most gentlemanly manner said to Gowing: “I don’t think you quite \r\nunderstand me.&nbsp; I intended to convey that our charming host and hostess \r\nwere superior to the follies of fashion, and preferred leading a simple and \r\nwholesome life to gadding about to twopenny-halfpenny tea-drinking afternoons, \r\nand living above their incomes.”</P>\r\n<P>I was immensely pleased with these sensible remarks of Merton’s, and \r\nconcluded that subject by saying: “No, candidly, Mr. Merton, we don’t go into \r\nSociety, because we do not care for it; and what with the expense of cabs here \r\nand cabs there, and white gloves and white ties, etc., it doesn’t seem worth the \r\nmoney.”</P>\r\n<P>Merton said in reference to <I>friends</I>: “My motto is ‘Few and True;’ and, \r\nby the way, I also apply that to wine, ‘Little and Good.’”&nbsp; Gowing said: \r\n“Yes, and sometimes ‘cheap and tasty,’ eh, old man?”&nbsp; Merton, still \r\ncontinuing, said he should treat me as a friend, and put me down for a dozen of \r\nhis “Lockanbar” whisky, and as I was an old friend of Gowing, I should have it \r\nfor 36s., which was considerably under what he paid for it.</P>\r\n<P>He booked his own order, and further said that at any time I wanted any \r\npasses for the theatre I was to let him know, as his name stood good for any \r\ntheatre in London.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 20<P class=check>Carrie reminded me that as her old school \r\nfriend, Annie Fullers (now Mrs. James), and her husband had come up from Sutton \r\nfor a few days, it would look kind to take them to the theatre, and would I drop \r\na line to Mr. Merton asking him for passes for four, either for the Italian \r\nOpera, Haymarket, Savoy, or Lyceum.&nbsp;

We got \r\na ’bus that took us to King’s Cross, and then changed into one that took us to \r\nthe “Angel.”&nbsp; Mr. James each time insisted on paying for all, saying that I \r\nhad paid for the tickets and that was quite enough.</P>\r\n<P>We arrived at theatre, where, curiously enough, all our ’bus-load except an \r\nold woman with a basket seemed to be going in.&nbsp; I walked ahead and \r\npresented the tickets.&nbsp; The man looked at them, and called out: “Mr. \r\nWillowly! do you know anything about these?” holding up my tickets.&nbsp; The \r\ngentleman called to came up and examined my tickets, and said: “Who gave you \r\nthese?”&nbsp; I said, rather indignantly: “Mr. Merton, of course.”&nbsp; He \r\nsaid: “Merton?&nbsp; Who’s he?”&nbsp; I answered, rather sharply: “You ought to \r\nknow, his name’s good at any theatre in London.”&nbsp; He replied: “Oh! is \r\nit?&nbsp; Well, it ain’t no good here.&nbsp; These tickets, which are not dated, \r\nwere issued under Mr. Swinstead’s management, which has since changed \r\nhands.”&nbsp; While I was having some very unpleasant words with the man, James, \r\nwho had gone upstairs with the ladies, called out: “Come on!”&nbsp; I went up \r\nafter them, and a very civil attendant said: “This way, please, box H.”&nbsp; I \r\nsaid to James: “Why, how on earth did you manage it?” and to my horror he \r\nreplied: “Why, paid for it of course.”</P>\r\n<P>This was humiliating enough, and I could scarcely follow the play, but I was \r\ndoomed to still further humiliation.&nbsp; I was leaning out of the box, when my \r\ntie—a little black bow which fastened on to the stud by means of a new \r\npatent—fell into the pit below.&nbsp; A clumsy man not noticing it, had his foot \r\non it for ever so long before he discovered it.&nbsp; He then picked it up and \r\neventually flung it under the next seat in disgust.&nbsp; What with the box \r\nincident and the tie, I felt quite miserable.&nbsp; Mr. James, of Sutton, was \r\nvery good.&nbsp; He said: “Don’t worry—no one will notice it with your \r\nbeard.&nbsp; That is the only advantage of growing one that I can see.”&nbsp; \r\nThere was no occasion for that remark, for Carrie is very proud of my beard.</P>\r\n<P>To hide the absence of the tie I had to keep my chin down the rest of the \r\nevening, which caused a pain at the back of my neck.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 24<P class=check>Could scarcely sleep a wink through \r\nthinking of having brought up Mr. and Mrs. James from the country to go to the \r\ntheatre last night, and his having paid for a private box because our order was \r\nnot honoured, and such a poor play too.&nbsp; I wrote a very satirical letter to \r\nMerton, the wine merchant, who gave us the pass, and said, “Considering we had \r\nto pay for our seats, we did our best to appreciate the performance.”&nbsp; I \r\nthought this line rather cutting, and I asked Carrie how many p’s there were in \r\nappreciate, and she said, “One.”&nbsp; After I sent off the letter I looked at \r\nthe dictionary and found there were two.&nbsp; Awfully vexed at this.</P>\r\n<P>Decided not to worry myself any more about the James’s; for, as Carrie wisely \r\nsaid, “We’ll make it all right with them by asking them up from Sutton one \r\nevening next week to play at Bézique.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 25<P class=check>In consequence of Brickwell telling me his \r\nwife was working wonders with the new Pinkford’s enamel paint, I determined to \r\ntry it.&nbsp;

Went upstairs into \r\nthe servant’s bedroom and painted her washstand, towel-horse, and chest of \r\ndrawers.&nbsp; To my mind it was an extraordinary improvement, but as an example \r\nof the ignorance of the lower classes in the matter of taste, our servant, \r\nSarah, on seeing them, evinced no sign of pleasure, but merely said “she thought \r\nthey looked very well as they was before.”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="3_1.gif"><br>I painted the washstand in the servant’s bedroom.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 26<P class=check>Got some more red enamel paint (red, to my \r\nmind, being the best colour), and painted the coal-scuttle, and the backs of our \r\n<I>Shakespeare</I>, the binding of which had almost worn out.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 27<P class=check>Painted the bath red, and was delighted \r\nwith the result.&nbsp; Sorry to say Carrie was not, in fact we had a few words \r\nabout it.&nbsp; She said I ought to have consulted her, and she had never heard \r\nof such a thing as a bath being painted red.&nbsp; I replied: “It’s merely a \r\nmatter of taste.”</P>\r\n<P>Fortunately, further argument on the subject was stopped by a voice saying, \r\n“May I come in?”&nbsp; It was only Cummings, who said, “Your maid opened the \r\ndoor, and asked me to excuse her showing me in, as she was wringing out some \r\nsocks.”&nbsp; I was delighted to see him, and suggested we should have a game of \r\nwhist with a dummy, and by way of merriment said: “You can be the dummy.”&nbsp; \r\nCummings (I thought rather ill-naturedly) replied: “Funny as usual.”&nbsp; He \r\nsaid he couldn’t stop, he only called to leave me the <I>Bicycle News</I>, as he \r\nhad done with it.</P>\r\n<P>Another ring at the bell; it was Gowing, who said he “must apologise for \r\ncoming so often, and that one of these days we must come round to \r\n<I>him</I>.”&nbsp; I said: “A very extraordinary thing has struck me.”&nbsp; \r\n“Something funny, as usual,” said Cummings.&nbsp; “Yes,” I replied; “I think \r\neven you will say so this time.&nbsp; It’s concerning you both; for doesn’t it \r\nseem odd that Gowing’s always coming and Cummings’ always going?”&nbsp; Carrie, \r\nwho had evidently quite forgotten about the bath, went into fits of laughter, \r\nand as for myself, I fairly doubled up in my chair, till it cracked beneath \r\nme.&nbsp; I think this was one of the best jokes I have ever made.</P>\r\n<P>Then imagine my astonishment on perceiving both Cummings and Gowing perfectly \r\nsilent, and without a smile on their faces.&nbsp; After rather an unpleasant \r\npause, Cummings, who had opened a cigar-case, closed it up again and said: \r\n“Yes—I think, after that, I <I>shall</I> be going, and I am sorry I fail to see \r\nthe fun of your jokes.”&nbsp; Gowing said he didn’t mind a joke when it wasn’t \r\nrude, but a pun on a name, to his thinking, was certainly a little wanting in \r\ngood taste.&nbsp; Cummings followed it up by saying, if it had been said by \r\nanyone else but myself, he shouldn’t have entered the house again.&nbsp; This \r\nrather unpleasantly terminated what might have been a cheerful evening.&nbsp; \r\nHowever, it was as well they went, for the charwoman had finished up the remains \r\nof the cold pork.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 28<P class=check>At the office, the new and very young \r\nclerk Pitt, who was very impudent to me a week or so ago, was late again.&nbsp;

Passing down the room an \r\nhour later.&nbsp; I received a smart smack in the face from a rolled-up ball of \r\nhard foolscap.&nbsp; I turned round sharply, but all the clerks were apparently \r\nriveted to their work.&nbsp; I am not a rich man, but I would give \r\nhalf-a-sovereign to know whether that was thrown by accident or design.&nbsp; \r\nWent home early and bought some more enamel paint—black this time—and spent the \r\nevening touching up the fender, picture-frames, and an old pair of boots, making \r\nthem look as good as new.&nbsp;

I had \r\ngot a chill, and decided to have a bath as hot as I could bear it.&nbsp; Bath \r\nready—could scarcely bear it so hot.&nbsp; I persevered, and got in; very hot, \r\nbut very acceptable.&nbsp;

My second thought was to ring the bell, but remembered \r\nthere was no bell to ring.&nbsp; My third was, that there was nothing but the \r\nenamel paint, which had dissolved with boiling water.&nbsp; I stepped out of the \r\nbath, perfectly red all over, resembling the Red Indians I have seen depicted at \r\nan East-End theatre.&nbsp; I determined not to say a word to Carrie, but to tell \r\nFarmerson to come on Monday and paint the bath white.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="3_2.gif"><br>I looked like Marat in the bath, in Madame Tussaud’s.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter IV</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>The ball at the Mansion House.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 30<P class=check>Perfectly astounded at receiving an \r\ninvitation for Carrie and myself from the Lord and Lady Mayoress to the Mansion \r\nHouse, to “meet the Representatives of Trades and Commerce.”&nbsp; My heart beat \r\nlike that of a schoolboy’s.&nbsp; Carrie and I read the invitation over two or \r\nthree times.&nbsp; I could scarcely eat my breakfast.&nbsp; I said—and I felt it \r\nfrom the bottom of my heart,—“Carrie darling, I was a proud man when I led you \r\ndown the aisle of the church on our wedding-day; that pride will be equalled, if \r\nnot surpassed, when I lead my dear, pretty wife up to the Lord and Lady Mayoress \r\nat the Mansion House.”&nbsp; I saw the tears in Carrie’s eyes, and she said: \r\n“Charlie dear, it is <I>I</I> who have to be proud of you.&nbsp; And I am very, \r\nvery proud of you.&nbsp; You have called me pretty; and as long as I am pretty \r\nin your eyes, I am happy.&nbsp; You, dear old Charlie, are not handsome, but you \r\nare <I>good</I>, which is far more noble.”&nbsp;

viz., the Lord Mayor’s \r\nreception.&nbsp; The whole house upset.&nbsp; I had to get dressed at half-past \r\nsix, as Carrie wanted the room to herself.&nbsp; Mrs. James had come up from \r\nSutton to help Carrie; so I could not help thinking it unreasonable that she \r\nshould require the entire attention of Sarah, the servant, as well.&nbsp; Sarah \r\nkept running out of the house to fetch “something for missis,” and several times \r\nI had, in my full evening-dress, to answer the back-door.</P>\r\n<P>The last time it was the greengrocer’s boy, who, not seeing it was me, for \r\nSarah had not lighted the gas, pushed into my hands two cabbages and \r\nhalf-a-dozen coal-blocks.&nbsp; I indignantly threw them on the ground, and felt \r\nso annoyed that I so far forgot myself as to box the boy’s ears.&nbsp; He went \r\naway crying, and said he should summons me, a thing I would not have happen for \r\nthe world.&nbsp; In the dark, I stepped on a piece of the cabbage, which brought \r\nme down on the flags all of a heap.&nbsp; For a moment I was stunned, but when I \r\nrecovered I crawled upstairs into the drawing-room and on looking into the \r\nchimney-glass discovered that my chin was bleeding, my shirt smeared with the \r\ncoal-blocks, and my left trouser torn at the knee.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="4_2.gif"><br>The greengrocer’s boy ... who pushed into my hands two cabbages and half-a-dozen coal-blocks.</P>\r\n<P>However, Mrs. James brought me down another shirt, which I changed in the \r\ndrawing-room.&nbsp; I put a piece of court-plaster on my chin, and Sarah very \r\nneatly sewed up the tear at the knee.&nbsp; At nine o’clock Carrie swept into \r\nthe room, looking like a queen.&nbsp; Never have I seen her look so lovely, or \r\nso distinguished.&nbsp; She was wearing a satin dress of sky-blue—my favourite \r\ncolour—and a piece of lace, which Mrs. James lent her, round the shoulders, to \r\ngive a finish.&nbsp; I thought perhaps the dress was a little too long behind, \r\nand decidedly too short in front, but Mrs. James said it was <I>à la \r\nmode</I>.&nbsp; Mrs. James was most kind, and lent Carrie a fan of ivory with \r\nred feathers, the value of which, she said, was priceless, as the feathers \r\nbelonged to the Kachu eagle—a bird now extinct.&nbsp; I preferred the little \r\nwhite fan which Carrie bought for three-and-six at Shoolbred’s, but both ladies \r\nsat on me at once.</P>\r\n<P>We arrived at the Mansion House too early, which was rather fortunate, for I \r\nhad an opportunity of speaking to his lordship, who graciously condescended to \r\ntalk with me some minutes; but I must say I was disappointed to find he did not \r\neven know Mr. Perkupp, our principal.</P>\r\n<P>I felt as if we had been invited to the Mansion House by one who did not know \r\nthe Lord Mayor himself.&nbsp; Crowds arrived, and I shall never forget the grand \r\nsight.&nbsp; My humble pen can never describe it.&nbsp; I was a little annoyed \r\nwith Carrie, who kept saying: “Isn’t it a pity we don’t know anybody?”</P>\r\n<P>Once she quite lost her head.&nbsp; I saw someone who looked like Franching, \r\nfrom Peckham, and was moving towards him when she seized me by the coat-tails, \r\nand said quite loudly: “Don’t leave me,” which caused an elderly gentleman, in a \r\ncourt-suit, and a chain round him, and two ladies, to burst out laughing.&nbsp; \r\nThere was an immense crowd in the supper-room, and, my stars! it was a splendid \r\nsupper—any amount of champagne.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie made a most hearty supper, for which I was pleased; for I sometimes \r\nthink she is not strong.&nbsp; There was scarcely a dish she did not \r\ntaste.&nbsp; I was so thirsty, I could not eat much.&nbsp; Receiving a sharp \r\nslap on the shoulder, I turned, and, to my amazement, saw Farmerson, our \r\nironmonger.&nbsp; He said, in the most familiar way: “This is better than \r\nBrickfield Terrace, eh?”&nbsp; I simply looked at him, and said coolly: “I never \r\nexpected to see you here.”&nbsp; He said, with a loud, coarse laugh: “I like \r\nthat—if <I>you</I>, why not <I>me</I>?”&nbsp; I replied: “Certainly,” I wish I \r\ncould have thought of something better to say.&nbsp; He said: “Can I get your \r\ngood lady anything?”&nbsp; Carrie said: “No, I thank you,” for which I was \r\npleased.&nbsp; I said, by way of reproof to him: “You never sent to-day to paint \r\nthe bath, as I requested.”&nbsp; Farmerson said: “Pardon me, Mr. Pooter, no shop \r\nwhen we’re in company, please.”</P>\r\n<P>Before I could think of a reply, one of the sheriffs, in full Court costume, \r\nslapped Farmerson on the back and hailed him as an old friend, and asked him to \r\ndine with him at his lodge.&nbsp; I was astonished.&nbsp; For full five minutes \r\nthey stood roaring with laughter, and stood digging each other in the \r\nribs.&nbsp; They kept telling each other they didn’t look a day older.&nbsp; \r\nThey began embracing each other and drinking champagne.</P>\r\n<P>To think that a man who mends our scraper should know any member of our \r\naristocracy!&nbsp; I was just moving with Carrie, when Farmerson seized me \r\nrather roughly by the collar, and addressing the sheriff, said: “Let me \r\nintroduce my neighbour, Pooter.”&nbsp; He did not even say “Mister.”&nbsp; The \r\nsheriff handed me a glass of champagne.&nbsp; I felt, after all, it was a great \r\nhonour to drink a glass of wine with him, and I told him so.&nbsp; We stood \r\nchatting for some time, and at last I said: “You must excuse me now if I join \r\nMrs. Pooter.”&nbsp; When I approached her, she said: “Don’t let me take you away \r\nfrom friends.&nbsp; I am quite happy standing here alone in a crowd, knowing \r\nnobody!”</P>\r\n<P>As it takes two to make a quarrel, and as it was neither the time nor the \r\nplace for it, I gave my arm to Carrie, and said: “I hope my darling little wife \r\nwill dance with me, if only for the sake of saying we had danced at the Mansion \r\nHouse as guests of the Lord Mayor.”&nbsp; Finding the dancing after supper was \r\nless formal, and knowing how much Carrie used to admire my dancing in the days \r\ngone by, I put my arm round her waist and we commenced a waltz.</P>\r\n<P>A most unfortunate accident occurred.&nbsp; I had got on a new pair of \r\nboots.&nbsp; Foolishly, I had omitted to take Carrie’s advice; namely, to \r\nscratch the soles of them with the points of the scissors or to put a little wet \r\non them.&nbsp; I had scarcely started when, like lightning, my left foot slipped \r\naway and I came down, the side of my head striking the floor with such violence \r\nthat for a second or two I did not know what had happened.&nbsp; I needly hardly \r\nsay that Carrie fell with me with equal violence, breaking the comb in her hair \r\nand grazing her elbow.</P>\r\n<P>There was a roar of laughter, which was immediately checked when people found \r\nthat we had really hurt ourselves.&nbsp; A gentleman assisted Carrie to a seat, \r\nand I expressed myself pretty strongly on the danger of having a plain polished \r\nfloor with no carpet or drugget to prevent people slipping.&nbsp; The gentleman, \r\nwho said his name was Darwitts, insisted on escorting Carrie to have a glass of \r\nwine, an invitation which I was pleased to allow Carrie to accept.</P>\r\n<P>I followed, and met Farmerson, who immediately said, in his loud voice “Oh, \r\nare you the one who went down?”</P>\r\n<P>I answered with an indignant look.</P>\r\n<P>With execrable taste, he said: “Look here, old man, we are too old for this \r\ngame.&nbsp; We must leave these capers to the youngsters.&nbsp; Come and have \r\nanother glass, that is more in our line.”</P>\r\n<P>Although I felt I was buying his silence by accepting, we followed the others \r\ninto the supper-room.</P>\r\n<P>Neither Carrie nor I, after our unfortunate mishap, felt inclined to stay \r\nlonger.&nbsp; As we were departing, Farmerson said: “Are you going? if so, you \r\nmight give me a lift.”</P>\r\n<P>I thought it better to consent, but wish I had first consulted Carrie.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter V</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>After the Mansion House Ball.&nbsp;

I felt irritated, and said: “What nonsense you talk; \r\nI only had a glass and a half, and you know as well as I do—”&nbsp; Before I \r\ncould complete the sentence she bounced out of the room.&nbsp;

Wrote to the <I>Blackfriars Bi-weekly News</I>, pointing out \r\ntheir omission.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie had commenced her breakfast when I entered the parlour.&nbsp; I helped \r\nmyself to a cup of tea, and I said, perfectly calmly and quietly: “Carrie, I \r\nwish a little explanation of your conduct last night.”</P>\r\n<P>She replied, “Indeed! and I desire something more than a little explanation \r\nof your conduct the night before.”</P>\r\n<P>I said, coolly: “Really, I don’t understand you.”</P>\r\n<P>Carrie said sneeringly: “Probably not; you were scarcely in a condition to \r\nunderstand anything.”</P>\r\n<P>I was astounded at this insinuation and simply ejaculated: “Caroline!”</P>\r\n<P>She said: “Don’t be theatrical, it has no effect on me.&nbsp; Reserve that \r\ntone for your new friend, Mister Farmerson, the ironmonger.”</P>\r\n<P>I was about to speak, when Carrie, in a temper such as I have never seen her \r\nin before, told me to hold my tongue.&nbsp; She said: “Now <I>I’m</I> going to \r\nsay something!&nbsp; After professing to snub Mr. Farmerson, you permit him to \r\nsnub <I>you</I>, in my presence, and then accept his invitation to take a glass \r\nof champagne with you, and you don’t limit yourself to one glass.&nbsp; You then \r\noffer this vulgar man, who made a bungle of repairing our scraper, a seat in our \r\ncab on the way home.&nbsp; I say nothing about his tearing my dress in getting \r\nin the cab, nor of treading on Mrs. James’s expensive fan, which you knocked out \r\nof my hand, and for which he never even apologised; but you smoked all the way \r\nhome without having the decency to ask my permission.&nbsp; That is not \r\nall!&nbsp; At the end of the journey, although he did not offer you a farthing \r\ntowards his share of the cab, you asked him in.&nbsp; Fortunately, he was sober \r\nenough to detect, from my manner, that his company was not desirable.”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="5_1.gif"><br>Mr. Farmerson smokes all the way home in the cab.</P>\r\n<P>Goodness knows I felt humiliated enough at this; but, to make matters worse, \r\nGowing entered the room, without knocking, with two hats on his head and holding \r\nthe garden-rake in his hand, with Carrie’s fur tippet (which he had taken off \r\nthe downstairs hall-peg) round his neck, and announced himself in a loud, coarse \r\nvoice: “His Royal Highness, the Lord Mayor!”&nbsp; He marched twice round the \r\nroom like a buffoon, and finding we took no notice, said: “Hulloh! what’s \r\nup?&nbsp; Lovers’ quarrel, eh?”</P>\r\n<P>There was a silence for a moment, so I said quietly: “My dear Gowing, I’m not \r\nvery well, and not quite in the humour for joking; especially when you enter the \r\nroom without knocking, an act which I fail to see the fun of.”</P>\r\n<P>Gowing said: “I’m very sorry, but I called for my stick, which I thought you \r\nwould have sent round.”&nbsp; I handed him his stick, which I remembered I had \r\npainted black with the enamel paint, thinking to improve it.&nbsp; He looked at \r\nit for a minute with a dazed expression and said: “Who did this?”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Eh, did what?”</P>\r\n<P>He said: “Did what?&nbsp; Why, destroyed my stick!&nbsp; It belonged to my \r\npoor uncle, and I value it more than anything I have in the world!&nbsp; I’ll \r\nknow who did it.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “I’m very sorry.&nbsp; I dare say it will come off.&nbsp; I did it \r\nfor the best.”</P>\r\n<P>Gowing said: “Then all I can say is, it’s a confounded liberty; and I \r\n<I>would</I> add, you’re a bigger fool than you look, only <I>that’s</I> \r\nabsolutely impossible.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>May</SPAN> 12<P class=check>Got a single copy of the <I>Blackfriars \r\nBi-weekly News</I>.&nbsp;

As I happened to be sitting next the driver \r\ngoing to town on the ’bus, I told him my joke about the “frayed” shirts.&nbsp; I \r\nthought he would have rolled off his seat.&nbsp; They laughed at the office a \r\ngood bit too over it.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>May</SPAN> 26<P class=check>Left the shirts to be repaired at \r\nTrillip’s.&nbsp;

Gowing was \r\nthere, also Mr. Stillbrook.&nbsp; It was quiet but pleasant.&nbsp; Mrs. Cummings \r\nsang five or six songs, “No, Sir,” and “The Garden of Sleep,” being best in my \r\nhumble judgment; but what pleased me most was the duet she sang with \r\nCarrie—classical duet, too.&nbsp; I think it is called, “I would that my \r\nlove!”&nbsp; It was beautiful.&nbsp; If Carrie had been in better voice, I don’t \r\nthink professionals could have sung it better.&nbsp; After supper we made them \r\nsing it again.&nbsp; I never liked Mr. Stillbrook since the walk that Sunday to \r\nthe “Cow and Hedge,” but I must say he sings comic-songs well.&nbsp; His song: \r\n“We don’t Want the old men now,” made us shriek with laughter, especially the \r\nverse referring to Mr. Gladstone; but there was one verse I think he might have \r\nomitted, and I said so, but Gowing thought it was the best of the lot.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>June</SPAN> 6<P class=check>Trillip brought round the shirts and, to my \r\ndisgust, his charge for repairing was more than I gave for them when new.&nbsp;

Met Mr. \r\nFranching, who lives at Peckham, and who is a great swell in his way.&nbsp; I \r\nventured to ask him to come home to meat-tea, and take pot-luck.&nbsp; I did not \r\nthink he would accept such a humble invitation; but he did, saying, in a most \r\nfriendly way, he would rather “peck” with us than by himself.&nbsp; I said: “We \r\nhad better get into this blue ’bus.”&nbsp; He replied: “No blue-bussing for \r\nme.&nbsp; I have had enough of the blues lately.&nbsp; I lost a cool ‘thou’ over \r\nthe Copper Scare.&nbsp; Step in here.”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=80% src="5_2.gif"><br>Mr. Franching, of Peckham.</P>\r\n<P>We drove up home in style, in a hansom-cab, and I knocked three times at the \r\nfront door without getting an answer.&nbsp; I saw Carrie, through the panels of \r\nground-glass (with stars), rushing upstairs.&nbsp; I told Mr. Franching to wait \r\nat the door while I went round to the side.&nbsp; There I saw the grocer’s boy \r\nactually picking off the paint on the door, which had formed into \r\nblisters.&nbsp; No time to reprove him; so went round and effected an entrance \r\nthrough the kitchen window.&nbsp; I let in Mr. Franching, and showed him into \r\nthe drawing-room.&nbsp; I went upstairs to Carrie, who was changing her dress, \r\nand told her I had persuaded Mr. Franching to come home.&nbsp; She replied: “How \r\ncan you do such a thing?&nbsp; You know it’s Sarah’s holiday, and there’s not a \r\nthing in the house, the cold mutton having turned with the hot weather.”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="5_3.gif"><br>The grocer’s boy was actually picking off the paint on the side door, which had formed into blisters.</P>\r\n<P>Eventually Carrie, like a good creature as she is, slipped down, washed up \r\nthe teacups, and laid the cloth, and I gave Franching our views of Japan to look \r\nat while I ran round to the butcher’s to get three chops.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>July</SPAN> 30<P class=check>The miserable cold weather is either \r\nupsetting me or Carrie, or both.&nbsp; We seem to break out into an argument \r\nabout absolutely nothing, and this unpleasant state of things usually occurs at \r\nmeal-times.</P>\r\n<P>This morning, for some unaccountable reason, we were talking about balloons, \r\nand we were as merry as possible; but the conversation drifted into family \r\nmatters, during which Carrie, without the slightest reason, referred in the most \r\nuncomplimentary manner to my poor father’s pecuniary trouble.&nbsp; I retorted \r\nby saying that “Pa, at all events, was a gentleman,” whereupon Carrie burst out \r\ncrying.&nbsp; I positively could not eat any breakfast.</P>\r\n<P>At the office I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, who said he was very sorry, but \r\nI should have to take my annual holidays from next Saturday.&nbsp; Franching \r\ncalled at office and asked me to dine at his club, “The Constitutional.”&nbsp; \r\nFearing disagreeables at home after the “tiff” this morning, I sent a telegram \r\nto Carrie, telling her I was going out to dine and she was not to sit up.&nbsp; \r\nBought a little silver bangle for Carrie.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>July</SPAN> 31<P class=check>Carrie was very pleased with the bangle, \r\nwhich I left with an affectionate note on her dressing-table last night before \r\ngoing to bed.&nbsp; I told Carrie we should have to start for our holiday next \r\nSaturday.&nbsp; She replied quite happily that she did not mind, except that the \r\nweather was so bad, and she feared that Miss Jibbons would not be able to get \r\nher a seaside dress in time.&nbsp; I told Carrie that I thought the drab one \r\nwith pink bows looked quite good enough; and Carrie said she should not think of \r\nwearing it.&nbsp; I was about to discuss the matter, when, remembering the \r\nargument yesterday, I resolved to hold my tongue.</P><P>I said to Carrie: “I don’t think we can do better than ‘Good old \r\nBroadstairs.’”&nbsp; Carrie not only, to my astonishment, raised an objection to \r\nBroadstairs, for the first time; but begged me not to use the expression, “Good \r\nold,” but to leave it to Mr. Stillbrook and other <I>gentlemen</I> of his \r\ntype.&nbsp; Hearing my ’bus pass the window, I was obliged to rush out of the \r\nhouse without kissing Carrie as usual; and I shouted to her: “I leave it to you \r\nto decide.”&nbsp; On returning in the evening, Carrie said she thought as the \r\ntime was so short she had decided on Broadstairs, and had written to Mrs. Beck, \r\nHarbour View Terrace, for apartments.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>August</SPAN> 1<P class=check>Ordered a new pair of trousers at \r\nEdwards’s, and told them not to cut them so loose over the boot;

In \r\nthe evening she trimmed herself a little sailor-hat, while I read to her the \r\n<I>Exchange and Mart</I>.&nbsp; We had a good laugh over my trying on the hat \r\nwhen she had finished it; Carrie saying it looked so funny with my beard, and \r\nhow the people would have roared if I went on the stage like it.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="5_4.gif"><br>Young Pitt called out “Hornpipe” as I passed his desk.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>August</SPAN> 2<P class=check>Mrs. Beck wrote to say we could have our \r\nusual rooms at Broadstairs.&nbsp;

I bought a capital hat for hot weather at the \r\nseaside.&nbsp; I don’t know what it is called, but it is the shape of the helmet \r\nworn in India, only made of straw.&nbsp; Got three new ties, two coloured \r\nhandkerchiefs, and a pair of navy-blue socks at Pope Brothers.&nbsp; Spent the \r\nevening packing.&nbsp; Carrie told me not to forget to borrow Mr. Higgsworth’s \r\ntelescope, which he always lends me, knowing I know how to take care of \r\nit.&nbsp; Sent Sarah out for it.&nbsp; While everything was seeming so bright, \r\nthe last post brought us a letter from Mrs. Beck, saying: “I have just let all \r\nmy house to one party, and am sorry I must take back my words, and am sorry you \r\nmust find other apartments;

To our utter amazement \r\nhe turned up himself in the afternoon, having journeyed all the way from \r\nOldham.&nbsp; He said he had got leave from the bank, and as Monday was a \r\nholiday he thought he would give us a little surprise.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>August</SPAN> 5<br>Sunday<P class=check>We have not seen Willie since last \r\nChristmas, and are pleased to notice what a fine young man he has grown.&nbsp; \r\nOne would scarcely believe he was Carrie’s son.&nbsp; He looks more like a \r\nyounger brother.&nbsp; I rather disapprove of his wearing a check suit on a \r\nSunday, and I think he ought to have gone to church this morning; but he said he \r\nwas tired after yesterday’s journey, so I refrained from any remark on the \r\nsubject.&nbsp; We had a bottle of port for dinner, and drank dear Willie’s \r\nhealth.</P>\r\n<P>He said: “Oh, by-the-by, did I tell you I’ve cut my first name, ‘William,’ \r\nand taken the second name ‘Lupin’?&nbsp;

I ventured to say that I thought \r\nWilliam a nice simple name, and reminded him he was christened after his Uncle \r\nWilliam, who was much respected in the City.&nbsp; Willie, in a manner which I \r\ndid not much care for, said sneeringly: “Oh, I know all about that—Good old \r\nBill!” and helped himself to a third glass of port.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie objected strongly to my saying “Good old,” but she made no remark when \r\nWillie used the double adjective.&nbsp; I said nothing, but looked at her, which \r\nmeant more.&nbsp; I said: “My dear Willie, I hope you are happy with your \r\ncolleagues at the Bank.”&nbsp; He replied: “Lupin, if you please; and with \r\nrespect to the Bank, there’s not a clerk who is a gentleman, and the ‘boss’ is a \r\ncad.”&nbsp;

He said: “Look here, Guv’nor, it’s no use \r\nbeating about the bush.&nbsp; I’ve tendered my resignation at the Bank.”</P>\r\n<P>For a moment I could not speak.&nbsp; When my speech came again, I said: “How \r\ndare you, sir?&nbsp;

I told him I was proud \r\nto say I had never heard of her.&nbsp; Carrie said: “Do let the boy alone.&nbsp; \r\nHe’s quite old enough to take care of himself, and won’t forget he’s a \r\ngentleman.&nbsp;

Lupin whispered to us that if we could only “draw out” Harry a \r\nbit, he would make us roar with laughter.</P>\r\n<P>At supper, young Mutlar did several amusing things.&nbsp; He took up a knife, \r\nand with the flat part of it played a tune on his cheek in a wonderful \r\nmanner.&nbsp;

I will leave \r\nthe house and never darken your doors again.”</P>\r\n<P>He went out of the house, slamming the hall-door.&nbsp; But it was all \r\nright.&nbsp; He came back to supper, and we played Bézique till nearly twelve \r\no’clock.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter IX</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Our first important Party.&nbsp; Old Friends and New Friends.&nbsp; Gowing is a little annoying; but his friend, Mr. Stillbrook, turns out to be quite amusing.&nbsp; Inopportune arrival of Mr. Perkupp, but he is most kind and complimentary.&nbsp; Party a great success.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 15<P class=check>A red-letter day.&nbsp; Our first \r\nimportant party since we have been in this house.&nbsp; I got home early from \r\nthe City.&nbsp; Lupin insisted on having a hired waiter, and stood a half-dozen \r\nof champagne.&nbsp; I think this an unnecessary expense, but Lupin said he had \r\nhad a piece of luck, having made three pounds out of a private deal in the City.&nbsp; I hope he won’t gamble in his new situation.&nbsp; The supper-room \r\nlooked so nice, and Carrie truly said: “We need not be ashamed of its being seen \r\nby Mr. Perkupp, should he honour us by coming.”</P>\r\n<P>I dressed early in case people should arrive punctually at eight o’clock, and \r\nwas much vexed to find my new dress-trousers much too short.</P>\r\n<P>Lupin, who is getting beyond his position, found fault with my wearing \r\nordinary boots instead of dress-boots.</P>\r\n<P>I replied satirically: “My dear son, I have lived to be above that sort of \r\nthing.”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin burst out laughing, and said: “A man generally was above his \r\nboots.”</P>\r\n<P>This may be funny, or it may <I>not</I>; but I was gratified to find he had \r\nnot discovered the coral had come off one of my studs.&nbsp; Carrie looked a \r\npicture, wearing the dress she wore at the Mansion House.&nbsp; The arrangement \r\nof the drawing-room was excellent.&nbsp; Carrie had hung muslin curtains over  the folding-doors, and also over one of the entrances, for we had removed the \r\ndoor from its hinges.</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Peters, the waiter, arrived in good time, and I gave him strict orders \r\nnot to open another bottle of champagne until the previous one was empty.&nbsp; \r\nCarrie arranged for some sherry and port wine to be placed on the drawing-room \r\nsideboard, with some glasses.&nbsp; By-the-by, our new enlarged and tinted \r\nphotographs look very nice on the walls, especially as Carrie has arranged some \r\nLiberty silk bows on the four corners of them.</P>\r\n<P>The first arrival was Gowing, who, with his usual taste, greeted me with: \r\n“Hulloh, Pooter, why your trousers are too short!”</P>\r\n<P>I simply said: “Very likely, and you will find my temper ‘<I>short</I>’ \r\nalso.”</P>\r\n<P>He said: “That won’t make your trousers longer, Juggins.&nbsp; You should get \r\nyour missus to put a flounce on them.”</P>\r\n<P>I wonder I waste my time entering his insulting observations in my diary.</P>\r\n<P>The next arrivals were Mr. and Mrs. Cummings.&nbsp; The former said: “As you \r\ndidn’t say anything about dress, I have come ‘half dress.’”&nbsp; He had on a \r\nblack frock-coat and white tie.&nbsp; The James’, Mr. Merton, and Mr. Stillbrook \r\narrived, but Lupin was restless and unbearable till his Daisy Mutlar and Frank \r\narrived.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie and I were rather startled at Daisy’s appearance.&nbsp; She had a \r\nbright-crimson dress on, cut very low in the neck.&nbsp; I do not think such a \r\nstyle modest.&nbsp; She ought to have taken a lesson from Carrie, and covered \r\nher shoulders with a little lace.&nbsp; Mr. Nackles, Mr. Sprice-Hogg and his \r\nfour daughters came; so did Franching, and one or two of Lupin’s new friends, \r\nmembers of the “Holloway Comedians.”&nbsp; Some of these seemed rather \r\ntheatrical in their manner, especially one, who was posing all the evening, and \r\nleant on our little round table and cracked it.&nbsp; Lupin called him “our \r\nHenry,” and said he was “our lead at the H.C.’s,” and was quite as good in that \r\ndepartment as Harry Mutlar was as the low-comedy merchant.&nbsp; All this is \r\nGreek to me.</P>\r\n<P>We had some music, and Lupin, who never left Daisy’s side for a moment, raved \r\nover her singing of a song, called “Some Day.”&nbsp; It seemed a pretty song, \r\nbut she made such grimaces, and sang, to my mind, so out of tune, I would not \r\nhave asked her to sing again; but Lupin made her sing four songs right off, one \r\nafter the other.</P>\r\n<P>At ten o’clock we went down to supper, and from the way Gowing and Cummings \r\nate you would have thought they had not had a meal for a month.&nbsp; I told \r\nCarrie to keep something back in case Mr. Perkupp should come by mere \r\nchance.&nbsp; Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler of \r\nchampagne, and drinking it straight off.&nbsp; He repeated this action, and made \r\nme fear our half-dozen of champagne would not last out.&nbsp; I tried to keep a \r\nbottle back, but Lupin got hold of it, and took it to the side-table with Daisy \r\nand Frank Mutlar.</P>\r\n<P>We went upstairs, and the young fellows began skylarking.&nbsp; Carrie put a \r\nstop to that at once.&nbsp; Stillbrook amused us with a song, “What have you \r\ndone with your Cousin John?”&nbsp; I did not notice that Lupin and Frank had \r\ndisappeared.&nbsp; I asked Mr. Watson, one of the Holloways, where they were, \r\nand he said: “It’s a case of ‘Oh, what a surprise!’”</P>\r\n<P>We were directed to form a circle—which we did.&nbsp; Watson then said: “I \r\nhave much pleasure in introducing the celebrated Blondin Donkey.”&nbsp; Frank \r\nand Lupin then bounded into the room.&nbsp; Lupin had whitened his face like a \r\nclown, and Frank had tied round his waist a large hearthrug.&nbsp; He was \r\nsupposed to be the donkey, and he looked it.&nbsp; They indulged in a very noisy \r\npantomime, and we were all shrieking with laughter.</P>\r\n<P>I turned round suddenly, and then I saw Mr. Perkupp standing half-way in the \r\ndoor, he having arrived without our knowing it.&nbsp; I beckoned to Carrie, and \r\nwe went up to him at once.&nbsp; He would not come right into the room.&nbsp; I \r\napologised for the foolery, but Mr. Perkupp said: “Oh, it seems amusing.”&nbsp; \r\nI could see he was not a bit amused.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie and I took him downstairs, but the table was a wreck.&nbsp; There was \r\nnot a glass of champagne left—not even a sandwich.&nbsp; Mr. Perkupp said he \r\nrequired nothing, but would like a glass of seltzer or soda water.&nbsp; The \r\nlast syphon was empty.&nbsp; Carrie said: “We have plenty of port wine \r\nleft.”&nbsp; Mr. Perkupp said, with a smile: “No, thank you.&nbsp; I really \r\nrequire nothing, but I am most pleased to see you and your husband in your own \r\nhome.&nbsp; Good-night, Mrs. Pooter—you will excuse my very short stay, I \r\nknow.”&nbsp; I went with him to his carriage, and he said: “Don’t trouble to \r\ncome to the office till twelve to-morrow.”</P>\r\n<P>I felt despondent as I went back to the house, and I told Carrie I thought \r\nthe party was a failure.&nbsp; Carrie said it was a great success, and I was \r\nonly tired, and insisted on my having some port myself.&nbsp; I drank two \r\nglasses, and felt much better, and we went into the drawing-room, where they had \r\ncommenced dancing.&nbsp; Carrie and I had a little dance, which I said reminded \r\nme of old days.&nbsp; She said I was a spooney old thing.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter X</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Reflections.&nbsp;

Finished off all the water in the bottle, as \r\nwell as half that in the jug.&nbsp; Kept dreaming also, that last night’s party \r\nwas a failure, and that a lot of low people came without invitation, and kept \r\nchaffing and throwing things at Mr. Perkupp, till at last I was obliged to hide \r\nhim in the box-room (which we had just discovered), with a bath-towel over \r\nhim.&nbsp; It seems absurd now, but it was painfully real in the dream.&nbsp; I \r\nhad the same dream about a dozen times.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie annoyed me by saying: “You know champagne never agrees with \r\nyou.”&nbsp; I told her I had only a couple of glasses of it, having kept myself \r\nentirely to port.&nbsp; I added that good champagne hurt nobody, and Lupin told \r\nme he had only got it from a traveller as a favour, as that particular brand had \r\nbeen entirely bought up by a West-End club.</P>\r\n<P>I think I ate too heartily of the “side dishes,” as the waiter called \r\nthem.&nbsp; I said to Carrie: “I wish I had put those ‘side dishes’ \r\n<I>aside</I>.”&nbsp; I repeated this, but Carrie was busy, packing up the \r\nteaspoons we had borrowed of Mrs. Cummings for the party.&nbsp; It was just \r\nhalf-past eleven, and I was starting for the office, when Lupin appeared, with a \r\nyellow complexion, and said: “Hulloh! Guv., what priced head have you this \r\nmorning?”&nbsp; I told him he might just as well speak to me in Dutch.&nbsp; He \r\nadded: “When I woke this morning, my head was as big as Baldwin’s \r\nballoon.”&nbsp; On the spur of the moment I said the cleverest thing I think I \r\nhave ever said; viz.: “Perhaps that accounts for the para<I>shooting</I> \r\npains.”&nbsp; We roared.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 17<P class=check>Still feel tired and headachy!&nbsp; In \r\nthe evening Gowing called, and was full of praise about our party last \r\nWednesday.&nbsp; He said everything was done beautifully, and he enjoyed himself \r\nenormously.&nbsp; Gowing can be a very nice fellow when he likes, but you never \r\nknow how long it will last.&nbsp; For instance, he stopped to supper, and seeing \r\nsome <I>blanc-mange</I> on the table, shouted out, while the servant was in the \r\nroom: “Hulloh!&nbsp; The remains of Wednesday?”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 18<P class=check>Woke up quite fresh after a good \r\nnight’s rest, and feel quite myself again.&nbsp; I am satisfied a life of \r\ngoing-out and Society is not a life for me; we therefore declined the invitation \r\nwhich we received this morning to Miss Bird’s wedding.&nbsp; We only met her \r\ntwice at Mrs. James’, and it means a present.&nbsp; Lupin said: “I am with you \r\nfor once.&nbsp; To my mind a wedding’s a very poor play.&nbsp; There are only \r\ntwo parts in it—the bride and bridegroom.&nbsp; The best man is only a walking \r\ngentleman.&nbsp; With the exception of a crying father and a snivelling mother, \r\nthe rest are <I>supers</I> who have to dress well and have to <I>pay</I> for \r\ntheir insignificant parts in the shape of costly presents.”&nbsp; I did not care \r\nfor the theatrical slang, but thought it clever, though disrespectful.</P>\r\n<P>I told Sarah not to bring up the <I>blanc-mange</I> again for \r\nbreakfast.&nbsp; It seems to have been placed on our table at every meal since \r\nWednesday.&nbsp; Cummings came round in the evening, and congratulated us on the \r\nsuccess of our party.&nbsp; He said it was the best party he had been to for \r\nmany a year; but he wished we had let him know it was full dress, as he would \r\nhave turned up in his swallow-tails.&nbsp; We sat down to a quiet game of \r\ndominoes, and were interrupted by the noisy entrance of Lupin and Frank \r\nMutlar.&nbsp; Cummings and I asked them to join us.&nbsp; Lupin said he did not \r\ncare for dominoes, and suggested a game of “Spoof.”&nbsp; On my asking if it \r\nrequired counters, Frank and Lupin in measured time said: “One, two, three; \r\ngo!&nbsp; Have you an estate in Greenland?”&nbsp; It was simply Greek to me, but \r\nit appears it is one of the customs of the “Holloway Comedians” to do this when \r\na member displays ignorance.</P>\r\n<P>In spite of my instructions, that <I>blanc-mange</I> was brought up again for \r\nsupper.&nbsp; To make matters worse, there had been an attempt to disguise it, \r\nby placing it in a glass dish with jam round it.&nbsp; Carrie asked Lupin if he \r\nwould have some, and he replied: “No second-hand goods for me, thank you.”&nbsp; \r\nI told Carrie, when we were alone, if that <I>blanc-mange</I> were placed on the \r\ntable again I should walk out of the house.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 19<br>Sunday<P class=check>A delightfully quiet day.&nbsp; \r\nIn the afternoon Lupin was off to spend the rest of the day with the \r\nMutlars.&nbsp; He departed in the best of spirits, and Carrie said: “Well, one \r\nadvantage of Lupin’s engagement with Daisy is that the boy seems happy all day \r\nlong.&nbsp; That quite reconciles me to what I must confess seems an imprudent \r\nengagement.”</P>\r\n<P>Carrie and I talked the matter over during the evening, and agreed that it \r\ndid not always follow that an early engagement meant an unhappy marriage.&nbsp; \r\nDear Carrie reminded me that we married early, and, with the exception of a few \r\ntrivial misunderstandings, we had never had a really serious word.&nbsp; I could \r\nnot help thinking (as I told her) that half the pleasures of life were derived \r\nfrom the little struggles and small privations that one had to endure at the \r\nbeginning of one’s married life.&nbsp; Such struggles were generally occasioned \r\nby want of means, and often helped to make loving couples stand together all the \r\nfirmer.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie said I had expressed myself wonderfully well, and that I was quite a \r\nphilosopher.</P>\r\n<P>We are all vain at times, and I must confess I felt flattered by Carrie’s \r\nlittle compliment.&nbsp; I don’t pretend to be able to express myself in fine \r\nlanguage, but I feel I have the power of expressing my thoughts with simplicity \r\nand lucidness.&nbsp; About nine o’clock, to our surprise, Lupin entered, with a \r\nwild, reckless look, and in a hollow voice, which I must say seemed rather \r\ntheatrical, said: “Have you any brandy?”&nbsp; I said: “No; but here is some \r\nwhisky.”&nbsp; Lupin drank off nearly a wineglassful without water, to my \r\nhorror.</P>\r\n<P>We all three sat reading in silence till ten, when Carrie and I rose to go to \r\nbed.&nbsp; Carrie said to Lupin: “I hope Daisy is well?”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin, with a forced careless air that he must have picked up from the \r\n“Holloway Comedians,” replied: “Oh, Daisy?&nbsp; You mean Miss Mutlar.&nbsp; I \r\ndon’t know whether she is well or not, but please <I>never to mention her name \r\nagain in my presence</I>.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter XI</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>We have a dose of Irving imitations.&nbsp;

Lupin said: \r\n“I’ll go where I can get some,” and walked out of the house.&nbsp; Carrie took \r\nthe boy’s part, and the rest of the evening was spent in a disagreeable \r\ndiscussion, in which the words “Daisy” and “Mutlar” must have occurred a \r\nthousand times.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 22<P class=check>Gowing and Cummings dropped in during \r\nthe evening.&nbsp; Lupin also came in, bringing his friend, Mr. \r\nBurwin-Fosselton—one of the “Holloway Comedians”—who was at our party the other \r\nnight, and who cracked our little round table.&nbsp; Happy to say Daisy Mutlar \r\nwas never referred to.&nbsp; The conversation was almost entirely monopolised by \r\nthe young fellow Fosselton, who not only looked rather like Mr. Irving, but \r\nseemed to imagine that he <I>was</I> the celebrated actor.&nbsp; I must say he \r\ngave some capital imitations of him.&nbsp; As he showed no signs of moving at \r\nsupper time, I said: “If you like to stay, Mr. Fosselton, for our usual \r\ncrust—pray do.”&nbsp; He replied: “Oh! thanks; but please call me \r\nBurwin-Fosselton.&nbsp; It is a double name.&nbsp; There are lots of Fosseltons, \r\nbut please call me Burwin-Fosselton.”</P>\r\n<P>He began doing the Irving business all through supper.&nbsp; He sank so low \r\ndown in his chair that his chin was almost on a level with the table, and twice \r\nhe kicked Carrie under the table, upset his wine, and flashed a knife \r\nuncomfortably near Gowing’s face.&nbsp; After supper he kept stretching out his \r\nlegs on the fender, indulging in scraps of quotations from plays which were \r\nGreek to me, and more than once knocked over the fire-irons, making a hideous \r\nrow—poor Carrie already having a bad headache.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="11_1.gif"><br>Mr. Burwin-Fosselton at supper.</P>\r\n<P>When he went, he said, to our surprise: “I will come to-morrow and bring my \r\nIrving make-up.”&nbsp; Gowing and Cummings said they would like to see it and \r\nwould come too.&nbsp; I could not help thinking they might as well give a party \r\nat my house while they are about it.&nbsp; However, as Carrie sensibly said: “Do \r\nanything, dear, to make Lupin forget the Daisy Mutlar business.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 23<P class=check>In the evening, Cummings came \r\nearly.&nbsp; Gowing came a little later and brought, without asking permission, \r\na fat and, I think, very vulgar-looking man named Padge, who appeared to be all \r\nmoustache.&nbsp; Gowing never attempted any apology to either of us, but said \r\nPadge wanted to see the Irving business, to which Padge said: “That’s right,” \r\nand that is about all he <I>did</I> say during the entire evening.&nbsp; Lupin \r\ncame in and seemed in much better spirits.&nbsp; He had prepared a bit of a \r\nsurprise.&nbsp; Mr. Burwin-Fosselton had come in with him, but had gone upstairs \r\nto get ready.&nbsp; In half-an-hour Lupin retired from the parlour, and \r\nreturning in a few minutes, announced “Mr. Henry Irving.”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=80% src="11_2.gif"><br>Mr. Padge.</P>\r\n<P>I must say we were all astounded.&nbsp; I never saw such a resemblance.&nbsp; \r\nIt was astonishing.&nbsp; The only person who did not appear interested was the \r\nman Padge, who had got the best arm-chair, and was puffing away at a foul pipe \r\ninto the fireplace.&nbsp; After some little time I said; “Why do actors always \r\nwear their hair so long?”&nbsp; Carrie in a moment said, “Mr. Hare doesn’t wear \r\nlong <I>hair</I>.”&nbsp; How we laughed except Mr. Fosselton, who said, in a \r\nrather patronising kind of way, “The joke, Mrs. Pooter, is extremely \r\nappropriate, if not altogether new.”&nbsp; Thinking this rather a snub, I said: \r\n“Mr. Fosselton, I fancy—”&nbsp; He interrupted me by saying: “Mr. \r\n<I>Burwin</I>-Fosselton, if you please,” which made me quite forget what I was \r\ngoing to say to him.&nbsp; During the supper Mr. Burwin-Fosselton again \r\nmonopolised the conversation with his Irving talk, and both Carrie and I came to \r\nthe conclusion one can have even too much imitation of Irving.&nbsp; After \r\nsupper, Mr. Burwin-Fosselton got a little too boisterous over his Irving \r\nimitation, and suddenly seizing Gowing by the collar of his coat, dug his \r\nthumb-nail, accidentally of course, into Gowing’s neck and took a piece of flesh \r\nout.&nbsp; Gowing was rightly annoyed, but that man Padge, who having declined \r\nour modest supper in order that he should not lose his comfortable chair, burst \r\ninto an uncontrollable fit of laughter at the little misadventure.&nbsp; I was \r\nso annoyed at the conduct of Padge, I said: “I suppose you would have laughed if \r\nhe had poked Mr. Gowing’s eye out?” to which Padge replied: “That’s right,” and \r\nlaughed more than ever.&nbsp; I think perhaps the greatest surprise was when we \r\nbroke up, for Mr. Burwin-Fosselton said: “Good-night, Mr. Pooter.&nbsp; I’m glad \r\nyou like the imitation, I’ll bring <I>the other make-up to-morrow \r\nnight</I>.”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=100% src="11_3.gif"><br>”Lupin annouces “Mr. Henry Irving.” </P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 24<P class=check>I went to town without a \r\npocket-handkerchief.&nbsp;

but Gowing sent round a little note \r\nsaying he hoped I would excuse his not turning up, which rather amused me.&nbsp; \r\nHe added that his neck was still painful.&nbsp; Of course, Burwin-Fosselton \r\ncame, but Lupin never turned up, and imagine my utter disgust when that man \r\nPadge actually came again, and not even accompanied by Gowing.&nbsp; I was \r\nexasperated, and said: “Mr. Padge, this is a <I>surprise</I>.”&nbsp; Dear \r\nCarrie, fearing unpleasantness, said: “Oh! I suppose Mr. Padge has only come to \r\nsee the other Irving make-up.”&nbsp; Mr. Padge said: “That’s right,” and took \r\nthe best chair again, from which he never moved the whole evening.</P>\r\n<P>My only consolation is, he takes no supper, so he is not an expensive guest, \r\nbut I shall speak to Gowing about the matter.&nbsp; The Irving imitations and \r\nconversations occupied the whole evening, till I was sick of it.&nbsp; Once we \r\nhad a rather heated discussion, which was commenced by Cummings saying that it \r\nappeared to him that Mr. Burwin-Fosselton was not only <I>like</I> Mr. Irving, \r\nbut was in his judgment every way as <I>good</I> or even <I>better</I>.&nbsp; I \r\nventured to remark that after all it was but an imitation of an original.</P>\r\n<P>Cummings said surely some imitations were better than the originals.&nbsp; I \r\nmade what I considered a very clever remark: “Without an original there can be \r\nno imitation.”&nbsp; Mr. Burwin-Fosselton said quite impertinently: “Don’t \r\ndiscuss me in my presence, if you please; and, Mr. Pooter, I should advise you \r\nto talk about what you understand;” to which that cad Padge replied: “That’s \r\nright.”&nbsp; Dear Carrie saved the whole thing by suddenly saying: “I’ll be \r\nEllen Terry.”&nbsp; Dear Carrie’s imitation wasn’t a bit liked, but she was so \r\nspontaneous and so funny that the disagreeable discussion passed off.&nbsp; When \r\nthey left, I very pointedly said to Mr. Burwin-Fosselton and Mr. Padge that we \r\nshould be engaged to-morrow evening.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 25<P class=check>Had a long letter from Mr. Fosselton \r\nrespecting last night’s Irving discussion.&nbsp; I was very angry, and I wrote \r\nand said I knew little or nothing about stage matters, was not in the least \r\ninterested in them and positively declined to be drawn into a discussion on the \r\nsubject, even at the risk of its leading to a breach of friendship.&nbsp; I \r\nnever wrote a more determined letter.</P>\r\n<P>On returning home at the usual hour on Saturday afternoon I met near the \r\nArchway Daisy Mutlar.&nbsp; My heart gave a leap.&nbsp; I bowed rather stiffly, \r\nbut she affected not to have seen me.&nbsp; Very much annoyed in the evening by \r\nthe laundress sending home an odd sock.&nbsp; Sarah said she sent two pairs, and \r\nthe laundress declared only a pair and a half were sent.&nbsp; I spoke to Carrie \r\nabout it, but she rather testily replied: “I am tired of speaking to her; you \r\nhad better go and speak to her yourself.&nbsp; She is outside.”&nbsp; I did so, \r\nbut the laundress declared that only an odd sock was sent.</P>\r\n<P>Gowing passed into the passage at this time and was rude enough to listen to \r\nthe conversation, and interrupting, said: “Don’t waste the odd sock, old man; do \r\nan act of charity and give it to some poor man with only one leg.”&nbsp; The \r\nlaundress giggled like an idiot.&nbsp; I was disgusted and walked upstairs for \r\nthe purpose of pinning down my collar, as the button had come off the back of my \r\nshirt.</P>\r\n<P>When I returned to the parlour, Gowing was retailing his idiotic joke about \r\nthe odd sock, and Carrie was roaring with laughter.&nbsp; I suppose I am losing \r\nmy sense of humour.&nbsp; I spoke my mind pretty freely about Padge.&nbsp; \r\nGowing said he had met him only once before that evening.&nbsp; He had been \r\nintroduced by a friend, and as he (Padge) had “stood” a good dinner, Gowing \r\nwished to show him some little return.&nbsp; Upon my word, Gowing’s coolness \r\nsurpasses all belief.&nbsp; Lupin came in before I could reply, and Gowing \r\nunfortunately inquired after Daisy Mutlar.&nbsp; Lupin shouted: “Mind your own \r\nbusiness, sir!” and bounced out of the room, slamming the door.&nbsp; The \r\nremainder of the night was Daisy Mutlar—Daisy Mutlar—Daisy Mutlar.&nbsp; Oh \r\ndear!</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>November</SPAN> 26<br>Sunday<P class=check>The curate preached a very good \r\nsermon to-day—very good indeed.&nbsp; His appearance is never so impressive as \r\nour dear old vicar’s, but I am bound to say his sermons are much more \r\nimpressive.&nbsp; A rather annoying incident occurred, of which I must make \r\nmention.&nbsp; Mrs. Fernlosse, who is quite a grand lady, living in one of those \r\nlarge houses in the Camden Road, stopped to speak to me after church, when we \r\nwere all coming out.&nbsp; I must say I felt flattered, for she is thought a \r\ngood deal of.&nbsp; I suppose she knew me through seeing me so often take round \r\nthe plate, especially as she always occupies the corner seat of the pew.&nbsp; \r\nShe is a very influential lady, and may have had something of the utmost \r\nimportance to say, but unfortunately, as she commenced to speak a strong gust of \r\nwind came and blew my hat off into the middle of the road.</P>\r\n<P>I had to run after it, and had the greatest difficulty in recovering \r\nit.&nbsp; When I had succeeded in doing so, I found Mrs. Fernlosse had walked on \r\nwith some swell friends, and I felt I could not well approach her now, \r\nespecially as my hat was smothered with mud.&nbsp; I cannot say how disappointed \r\nI felt.</P>\r\n<P>In the evening (<I>Sunday</I> evening of all others) I found an impertinent \r\nnote from Mr. Burwin-Fosselton, which ran as follows:</P>\r\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n  <P>“<SPAN class=smcap>Dear Mr. Pooter</SPAN>,—Although your junior by perhaps \r\n  some twenty or thirty years—which is sufficient reason that you ought to have \r\n  a longer record of the things and ways in this miniature of a planet—I feel it \r\n  is just within the bounds of possibility that the wheels of your life don’t \r\n  travel so quickly round as those of the humble writer of these lines.&nbsp;

Lupin’s opinion of ’Xmas.&nbsp; Lupin’s unfortunate engagement is on again.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 17<P class=check>As I open my scribbling diary I find \r\nthe words “Oxford Michaelmas Term ends.”&nbsp; Why this should induce me to \r\nindulge in retrospective I don’t know, but it does.&nbsp; The last few weeks of \r\nmy diary are of minimum interest.&nbsp; The breaking off of the engagement \r\nbetween Lupin and Daisy Mutlar has made him a different being, and Carrie a \r\nrather depressing companion.&nbsp; She was a little dull last Saturday, and I \r\nthought to cheer her up by reading some extracts from my diary; but she walked \r\nout of the room in the middle of the reading, without a word.&nbsp; On her \r\nreturn, I said: “Did my diary bore you, darling?”</P>\r\n<P>She replied, to my surprise: “I really wasn’t listening, dear.&nbsp; I was \r\nobliged to leave to give instructions to the laundress.&nbsp; In consequence of \r\nsome stuff she puts in the water, two more of Lupin’s coloured shirts have run \r\nand he says he won’t wear them.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Everything is Lupin.&nbsp; It’s all Lupin, Lupin, Lupin.&nbsp; There \r\nwas not a single button on my shirt yesterday, but <I>I</I> made no \r\ncomplaint.”</P>\r\n<P>Carrie simply replied: “You should do as all other men do, and wear \r\nstuds.&nbsp; In fact, I never saw anyone but you wear buttons on the \r\nshirt-fronts.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “I certainly wore none yesterday, for there were none on.”</P>\r\n<P>Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the evening, \r\nand Cummings never does.&nbsp; I fear they don’t get on well with Lupin.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 18<P class=check>Yesterday I was in a retrospective \r\nvein—to-day it is <I>prospective</I>.&nbsp; I see nothing but clouds, clouds, \r\nclouds.&nbsp; Lupin is perfectly intolerable over the Daisy Mutlar \r\nbusiness.&nbsp; He won’t say what is the cause of the breach.&nbsp; He is \r\nevidently condemning her conduct, and yet, if we venture to agree with him, says \r\nhe won’t hear a word against her.&nbsp; So what is one to do?&nbsp; Another \r\nthing which is disappointing to me is, that Carrie and Lupin take no interest \r\nwhatever in my diary.</P>\r\n<P>I broached the subject at the breakfast-table to-day.&nbsp; I said: “I was in \r\nhopes that, if anything ever happened to me, the diary would be an endless \r\nsource of pleasure to you both; to say nothing of the chance of the remuneration \r\nwhich may accrue from its being published.”</P>\r\n<P>Both Carrie and Lupin burst out laughing.&nbsp; Carrie was sorry for this, I \r\ncould see, for she said: “I did not mean to be rude, dear Charlie; but truly I \r\ndo not think your diary would sufficiently interest the public to be taken up by \r\na publisher.”</P>\r\n<P>I replied: “I am sure it would prove quite as interesting as some of the \r\nridiculous reminiscences that have been published lately.&nbsp; Besides, it’s \r\nthe diary that makes the man.&nbsp; Where would Evelyn and Pepys have been if it \r\nhad not been for their diaries?”</P>\r\n<P>Carrie said I was quite a philosopher; but Lupin, in a jeering tone, said: \r\n“If it had been written on larger paper, Guv., we might get a fair price from a \r\nbutterman for it.”</P>\r\n<P>As I am in the prospective vein, I vow the end of this year will see the end \r\nof my diary.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 19<P class=check>The annual invitation came to spend \r\nChristmas with Carrie’s mother—the usual family festive gathering to which we \r\nalways look forward.&nbsp; Lupin declined to go.&nbsp; I was astounded, and \r\nexpressed my surprise and disgust.&nbsp; Lupin then obliged us with the \r\nfollowing Radical speech: “I hate a family gathering at Christmas.&nbsp; What \r\ndoes it mean?&nbsp; Why someone says: ‘Ah! we miss poor Uncle James, who was \r\nhere last year,’ and we all begin to snivel.&nbsp; Someone else says: ‘It’s two \r\nyears since poor Aunt Liz used to sit in that corner.’&nbsp; Then we all begin \r\nto snivel again.&nbsp; Then another gloomy relation says ‘Ah!&nbsp; I wonder \r\nwhose turn it will be next?’&nbsp; Then we all snivel again, and proceed to eat \r\nand drink too much; and they don’t discover until <I>I</I> get up that we have \r\nbeen seated thirteen at dinner.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 20<P class=check>Went to Smirksons’, the drapers, in the \r\nStrand, who this year have turned out everything in the shop and devoted the \r\nwhole place to the sale of Christmas cards.&nbsp; Shop crowded with people, who \r\nseemed to take up the cards rather roughly, and, after a hurried glance at them, \r\nthrow them down again.&nbsp; I remarked to one of the young persons serving, \r\nthat carelessness appeared to be a disease with some purchasers.&nbsp; The \r\nobservation was scarcely out of my mouth, when my thick coat-sleeve caught \r\nagainst a large pile of expensive cards in boxes one on top of the other, and \r\nthrew them down.&nbsp; The manager came forward, looking very much annoyed, and \r\npicking up several cards from the ground, said to one of the assistants, with a \r\npalpable side-glance at me: “Put these amongst the sixpenny goods; they can’t be \r\nsold for a shilling now.”&nbsp; The result was, I felt it my duty to buy some of \r\nthese damaged cards.</P>\r\n<P>I had to buy more and pay more than intended.&nbsp; Unfortunately I did not \r\nexamine them all, and when I got home I discovered a vulgar card with a picture \r\nof a fat nurse with two babies, one black and the other white, and the words: \r\n“We wish Pa a Merry Christmas.”&nbsp; I tore up the card and threw it \r\naway.&nbsp; Carrie said the great disadvantage of going out in Society and \r\nincreasing the number of our friends was, that we should have to send out nearly \r\ntwo dozen cards this year.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 21<P class=check>To save the postman a miserable \r\nChristmas, we follow the example of all unselfish people, and send out our cards \r\nearly.&nbsp; Most of the cards had finger-marks, which I did not notice at \r\nnight.&nbsp; I shall buy all future cards in the daytime.&nbsp; Lupin (who, ever \r\nsince he has had the appointment with a stock and share broker, does not seem \r\nover-scrupulous in his dealings) told me never to rub out the pencilled price on \r\nthe backs of the cards.&nbsp; I asked him why.&nbsp; Lupin said: “Suppose your \r\ncard is marked 9d.&nbsp; Well, all you have to do is to pencil a 3—and a long \r\ndown-stroke after it—in <I>front</I> of the ninepence, and people will think you \r\nhave given five times the price for it.”</P>\r\n<P>In the evening Lupin was very low-spirited, and I reminded him that behind \r\nthe clouds the sun was shining.&nbsp; He said: “Ugh! it never shines on \r\nme.”&nbsp; I said: “Stop, Lupin, my boy; you are worried about Daisy \r\nMutlar.&nbsp; Don’t think of her any more.&nbsp; You ought to congratulate \r\nyourself on having got off a very bad bargain.&nbsp; Her notions are far too \r\ngrand for our simple tastes.”&nbsp; He jumped up and said: “I won’t allow one \r\nword to be uttered against her.&nbsp; She’s worth the whole bunch of your \r\nfriends put together, that inflated, sloping-head of a Perkupp included.”&nbsp; \r\nI left the room with silent dignity, but caught my foot in the mat.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 23<P class=check>I exchanged no words with Lupin in the \r\nmorning; but as he seemed to be in exuberant spirits in the evening, I ventured \r\nto ask him where he intended to spend his Christmas.&nbsp; He replied: “Oh, most \r\nlikely at the Mutlars’.”</P>\r\n<P>In wonderment, I said: “What! after your engagement has been broken off?”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “Who said it is off?”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “You have given us both to understand—”</P>\r\n<P>He interrupted me by saying: “Well, never mind what I said.&nbsp;

A Mr. Moss is rather too free.&nbsp; A boisterous evening, during which I am struck in the dark.&nbsp; I receive an extraordinary letter from Mr. Mutlar, senior, respecting Lupin.&nbsp; We miss drinking out the Old Year.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 24<P class=check>I am a poor man, but I would gladly \r\ngive ten shillings to find out who sent me the insulting Christmas card I \r\nreceived this morning.&nbsp; I never insult people; why should they insult \r\nme?&nbsp; The worst part of the transaction is, that I find myself suspecting \r\nall my friends.&nbsp; The handwriting on the envelope is evidently disguised, \r\nbeing written sloping the wrong way.&nbsp; I cannot think either Gowing or \r\nCummings would do such a mean thing.&nbsp; Lupin denied all knowledge of it, and \r\nI believe him; although I disapprove of his laughing and sympathising with the \r\noffender.&nbsp; Mr. Franching would be above such an act; and I don’t think any \r\nof the Mutlars would descend to such a course.&nbsp; I wonder if Pitt, that \r\nimpudent clerk at the office, did it?&nbsp; Or Mrs. Birrell, the charwoman, or \r\nBurwin-Fosselton?&nbsp; The writing is too good for the former.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 25<br>Christmas Day<P class=check>We caught the 10.20 train at \r\nPaddington, and spent a pleasant day at Carrie’s mother’s.&nbsp; The country was \r\nquite nice and pleasant, although the roads were sloppy.&nbsp; We dined in the \r\nmiddle of the day, just ten of us, and talked over old times.&nbsp; If everybody \r\nhad a nice, <I>un</I>interfering mother-in-law, such as I have, what a deal of \r\nhappiness there would be in the world.&nbsp; Being all in good spirits, I \r\nproposed her health, and I made, I think, a very good speech.</P>\r\n<P>I concluded, rather neatly, by saying: “On an occasion like this—whether \r\nrelatives, friends, or acquaintances,—we are all inspired with good feelings \r\ntowards each other.&nbsp; We are of one mind, and think only of love and \r\nfriendship.&nbsp; Those who have quarrelled with absent friends should kiss and \r\nmake it up.&nbsp; Those who happily have not fallen out, can kiss all the \r\nsame.”</P>\r\n<P>I saw the tears in the eyes of both Carrie and her mother, and must say I \r\nfelt very flattered by the compliment.&nbsp; That dear old Reverend John Panzy \r\nSmith, who married us, made a most cheerful and amusing speech, and said he \r\nshould act on my suggestion respecting the kissing.&nbsp; He then walked round \r\nthe table and kissed all the ladies, including Carrie.&nbsp; Of course one did \r\nnot object to this; but I was more than staggered when a young fellow named \r\nMoss, who was a stranger to me, and who had scarcely spoken a word through \r\ndinner, jumped up suddenly with a sprig of misletoe, and exclaimed: \r\n“Hulloh!&nbsp; I don’t see why I shouldn’t be on in this scene.”&nbsp; Before \r\none could realise what he was about to do, he kissed Carrie and the rest of the \r\nladies.</P>\r\n<P>Fortunately the matter was treated as a joke, and we all laughed; but it was \r\na dangerous experiment, and I felt very uneasy for a moment as to the \r\nresult.&nbsp; I subsequently referred to the matter to Carrie, but she said: \r\n“Oh, he’s not much more than a boy.”&nbsp; I said that he had a very large \r\nmoustache for a boy.&nbsp; Carrie replied: “I didn’t say he was not a nice \r\nboy.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 26<P class=check>I did not sleep very well last night;

He said he enjoyed his Christmas, and \r\nadded: “I feel as fit as a Lowther Arcade fiddle, and only require a little more \r\n‘oof’ to feel as fit as a £500 Stradivarius.”&nbsp; I have long since given up \r\ntrying to understand Lupin’s slang, or asking him to explain it.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 27<P class=check>I told Lupin I was expecting Gowing and \r\nCummings to drop in to-morrow evening for a quiet game.&nbsp; I was in hope the \r\nboy would volunteer to stay in, and help to amuse them.&nbsp; Instead of which, \r\nhe said: “Oh, you had better put them off, as I have asked Daisy and Frank \r\nMutlar to come.”&nbsp; I said I could not think of doing such a thing.&nbsp; \r\nLupin said: “Then I will send a wire, and put off Daisy.”&nbsp; I suggested that \r\na post-card or letter would reach her quite soon enough, and would not be so \r\nextravagant.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie, who had listened to the above conversation with apparent annoyance, \r\ndirected a well-aimed shaft at Lupin.&nbsp; She said: “Lupin, why do you object \r\nto Daisy meeting your father’s friends?&nbsp; Is it because they are not good \r\nenough for her, or (which is equally possible) <I>she</I> is not good enough for \r\nthem?”&nbsp; Lupin was dumbfounded, and could make no reply.&nbsp; When he left \r\nthe room, I gave Carrie a kiss of approval.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 28<P class=check>Lupin, on coming down to breakfast, said \r\nto his mother: “I have not put off Daisy and Frank, and should like them to join \r\nGowing and Cummings this evening.”&nbsp; I felt very pleased with the boy for \r\nthis.&nbsp; Carrie said, in reply: “I am glad you let me know in time, as I can \r\nturn over the cold leg of mutton, dress it with a little parsley, and no one \r\nwill know it has been cut.”&nbsp; She further said she would make a few \r\ncustards, and stew some pippins, so that they would be cold by the evening.</P>\r\n<P>Finding Lupin in good spirits, I asked him quietly if he really had any \r\npersonal objection to either Gowing or Cummings.&nbsp; He replied: “Not in the \r\nleast.&nbsp; I think Cummings looks rather an ass, but that is partly due to his \r\npatronising ‘the three-and-six-one-price hat company,’ and wearing a \r\nreach-me-down frock-coat.&nbsp; As for that perpetual brown velveteen jacket of \r\nGowing’s—why, he resembles an itinerant photographer.”</P>\r\n<P>I said it was not the coat that made the gentleman; whereupon Lupin, with a \r\nlaugh, replied: “No, and it wasn’t much of a gentleman who made their \r\ncoats.”</P>\r\n<P>We were rather jolly at supper, and Daisy made herself very agreeable, \r\nespecially in the earlier part of the evening, when she sang.&nbsp; At supper, \r\nhowever, she said: “Can you make tee-to-tums with bread?” and she commenced \r\nrolling up pieces of bread, and twisting them round on the table.&nbsp; I felt \r\nthis to be bad manners, but of course said nothing.&nbsp; Presently Daisy and \r\nLupin, to my disgust, began throwing bread-pills at each other.&nbsp; Frank \r\nfollowed suit, and so did Cummings and Gowing, to my astonishment.&nbsp; They \r\nthen commenced throwing hard pieces of crust, one piece catching me on the \r\nforehead, and making me blink.&nbsp; I said: “Steady, please; steady!”&nbsp; \r\nFrank jumped up and said: “Tum, tum; then the band played.”</P>\r\n<P>I did not know what this meant, but they all roared, and continued the \r\nbread-battle.&nbsp; Gowing suddenly seized all the parsley off the cold mutton, \r\nand threw it full in my face.&nbsp; I looked daggers at Gowing, who replied: “I \r\nsay, it’s no good trying to look indignant, with your hair full of \r\nparsley.”&nbsp; I rose from the table, and insisted that a stop should be put to \r\nthis foolery at once.&nbsp; Frank Mutlar shouted: “Time, gentlemen, please! \r\ntime!” and turned out the gas, leaving us in absolute darkness.</P>\r\n<P>I was feeling my way out of the room, when I suddenly received a hard \r\nintentional punch at the back of my head.&nbsp; I said loudly: “Who did \r\nthat?”&nbsp; There was no answer; so I repeated the question, with the same \r\nresult.&nbsp; I struck a match, and lighted the gas.&nbsp; They were all talking \r\nand laughing, so I kept my own counsel; but, after they had gone, I said to \r\nCarrie; “The person who sent me that insulting post-card at Christmas was here \r\nto-night.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 29<P class=check>I had a most vivid dream last \r\nnight.&nbsp;

As fate would have it, Lupin, \r\nat breakfast, was reading extracts from a letter he had just received from \r\nFrank.</P>\r\n<P>I asked him to pass the envelope, that I might compare the writing.&nbsp; He \r\ndid so, and I examined it by the side of the envelope containing the Christmas \r\ncard.&nbsp; I detected a similarity in the writing, in spite of the attempted \r\ndisguise.&nbsp; I passed them on to Carrie, who began to laugh.&nbsp; I asked \r\nher what she was laughing at, and she said the card was never directed to me at \r\nall.&nbsp; It was “L. Pooter,” not “C. Pooter.”&nbsp; Lupin asked to look at the \r\ndirection and the card, and exclaimed, with a laugh: “Oh yes, Guv., it’s meant \r\nfor me.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Are you in the habit of receiving insulting Christmas cards?”&nbsp; \r\nHe replied: “Oh yes, and of <I>sending</I> them, too.”</P>\r\n<P>In the evening Gowing called, and said he enjoyed himself very much last \r\nnight.&nbsp; I took the opportunity to confide in him, as an old friend, about \r\nthe vicious punch last night.&nbsp; He burst out laughing, and said: “Oh, it was \r\n<I>your head</I>, was it?&nbsp; I know I accidentally hit something, but I \r\nthought it was a brick wall.”&nbsp; I told him I felt hurt, in both senses of \r\nthe expression.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>December</SPAN> 30<br>Sunday<P class=check>Lupin spent the whole day with \r\nthe Mutlars.&nbsp;

What \r\nwith his meanness over his cigars, his stinginess over his drinks, his farthing \r\neconomy in turning down the gas if you only quit the room for a second, writing \r\nto one on half-sheets of note-paper, sticking the remnant of the last cake of \r\nsoap on to the new cake, putting two bricks on each side of the fireplace, and \r\nhis general ‘outside-halfpenny-‘bus-ness,’ I was compelled to let him have a bit \r\nof my mind.”&nbsp;

Under the circumstances, it has become my duty to forbid \r\nyour son to enter my house again.&nbsp; I am sorry, because it deprives me of \r\nthe society of one of the most modest, unassuming, and gentlemanly persons I \r\nhave ever had the honour of being acquainted with.”</P>\r\n<P>I did not desire the last day to wind up disagreeably, so I said nothing to \r\neither Carrie or Lupin about the letter.</P>\r\n<P>A most terrible fog came on, and Lupin would go out in it, but promised to be \r\nback to drink out the Old Year—a custom we have always observed.&nbsp; At a \r\nquarter to twelve Lupin had not returned, and the fog was fearful.&nbsp; As time \r\nwas drawing close, I got out the spirits.&nbsp; Carrie and I deciding on whisky, \r\nI opened a fresh bottle; but Carrie said it smelt like brandy.&nbsp; As I knew \r\nit to be whisky, I said there was nothing to discuss.&nbsp; Carrie, evidently \r\nvexed that Lupin had not come in, did discuss it all the same, and wanted me to \r\nhave a small wager with her to decide by the smell.&nbsp; I said I could decide \r\nit by the taste in a moment.&nbsp; A silly and unnecessary argument followed, \r\nthe result of which was we suddenly saw it was a quarter-past twelve, and, for \r\nthe first time in our married life, we missed welcoming in the New Year.&nbsp; \r\nLupin got home at a quarter-past two, having got lost in the fog—so he said.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter XIV</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Begin the year with an unexpected promotion at the office.&nbsp;

but a most important event has happened, so I shall continue for a little \r\nwhile longer on the fly-leaves attached to the end of my last year’s \r\ndiary.&nbsp; It had just struck half-past one, and I was on the point of leaving \r\nthe office to have my dinner, when I received a message that Mr. Perkupp desired \r\nto see me at once.&nbsp; I must confess that my heart commenced to beat and I \r\nhad most serious misgivings.</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Perkupp was in his room writing, and he said: “Take a seat, Mr. Pooter, I \r\nshall not be a moment.”</P>\r\n<P>I replied: “No, thank you, sir; I’ll stand.”</P>\r\n<P>I watched the clock on the mantelpiece, and I was waiting quite twenty \r\nminutes; but it seemed hours.&nbsp; Mr. Perkupp at last got up himself.</P>\r\n<P>I said: “I hope there is nothing wrong, sir?”</P>\r\n<P>He replied: “Oh dear, no! quite the reverse, I hope.”&nbsp; What a weight off \r\nmy mind!&nbsp; My breath seemed to come back again in an instant.</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Perkupp said: “Mr. Buckling is going to retire, and there will be some \r\nslight changes in the office.&nbsp; You have been with us nearly twenty-one \r\nyears, and, in consequence of your conduct during that period, we intend making \r\na special promotion in your favour.&nbsp; We have not quite decided how you will \r\nbe placed; but in any case there will be a considerable increase in your salary, \r\nwhich, it is quite unnecessary for me to say, you fully deserve.&nbsp; I have an \r\nappointment at two; but you shall hear more to-morrow.”</P>\r\n<P>He then left the room quickly, and I was not even allowed time or thought to \r\nexpress a single word of grateful thanks to him.&nbsp; I need not say how dear \r\nCarrie received this joyful news.&nbsp; With perfect simplicity she said: “At \r\nlast we shall be able to have a chimney-glass for the back drawing-room, which \r\nwe always wanted.”&nbsp; I added: “Yes, and at last you shall have that little \r\ncostume which you saw at Peter Robinson’s so cheap.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>January</SPAN> 2<P class=check>I was in a great state of suspense all \r\nday at the office.&nbsp; I did not like to worry Mr. Perkupp; but as he did not \r\nsend for me, and mentioned yesterday that he would see me again to-day, I \r\nthought it better, perhaps, to go to him.&nbsp; I knocked at his door, and on \r\nentering, Mr. Perkupp said: “Oh! it’s you, Mr. Pooter; do you want to see \r\nme?”&nbsp; I said: “No, sir, I thought you wanted to see me!”&nbsp; “Oh!” he \r\nreplied, “I remember.&nbsp; Well, I am very busy to-day; I will see you \r\nto-morrow.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>January</SPAN> 3<P class=check>Still in a state of anxiety and \r\nexcitement, which was not alleviated by ascertaining that Mr. Perkupp sent word \r\nhe should not be at the office to-day.&nbsp; In the evening, Lupin, who was \r\nbusily engaged with a paper, said suddenly to me: “Do you know anything about \r\n<I>chalk pits</I>, Guv.?”&nbsp; I said: “No, my boy, not that I’m aware \r\nof.”&nbsp; Lupin said: “Well, I give you the tip; <I>chalk pits</I> are as safe \r\nas Consols, and pay six per cent. at par.”&nbsp; I said a rather neat thing, \r\nviz.: “They may be six per cent. at <I>par</I>, but your <I>pa</I> has no money \r\nto invest.”&nbsp; Carrie and I both roared with laughter.&nbsp; Lupin did not \r\ntake the slightest notice of the joke, although I purposely repeated it for him; \r\nbut continued: “I give you the tip, that’s all—<I>chalk pits</I>!”&nbsp; I said \r\nanother funny thing: “Mind you don’t fall into them!”&nbsp; Lupin put on a \r\nsupercilious smile, and said: “Bravo!&nbsp; Joe Miller.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>January</SPAN> 4<P class=check>Mr. Perkupp sent for me and told me that \r\nmy position would be that of one of the senior clerks.&nbsp;

That reminded me that I had forgotten to speak \r\nto Lupin about the letter I received from Mr. Mutlar, senr.&nbsp; I broached the \r\nsubject to Lupin in the evening, having first consulted Carrie.&nbsp; Lupin was \r\nriveted to the <I>Financial News</I>, as if he had been a born capitalist, and I \r\nsaid: “Pardon me a moment, Lupin, how is it you have not been to the Mutlars’ \r\nany day this week?”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin answered: “I told you!&nbsp; I cannot stand old Mutlar.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Mr. Mutlar writes to me to say pretty plainly that he cannot stand \r\nyou!”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “Well, I like his cheek in writing to <I>you</I>.&nbsp; I’ll find \r\nout if his father is still alive, and I will write <I>him</I> a note complaining \r\nof <I>his</I> son, and I’ll state pretty clearly that his son is a blithering \r\nidiot!”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Lupin, please moderate your expressions in the presence of your \r\nmother.”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “I’m very sorry, but there is no other expression one can apply \r\nto him.&nbsp; However, I’m determined not to enter his place again.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “You know, Lupin, he has forbidden you the house.”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin replied: “Well, we won’t split straws—it’s all the same.&nbsp; Daisy is \r\na trump, and will wait for me ten years, if necessary.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>January</SPAN> 5<P class=check>I can scarcely write the news.&nbsp; Mr. \r\nPerkupp told me my salary would be raised £100!&nbsp; I stood gaping for a \r\nmoment unable to realise it.&nbsp; I annually get £10 rise, and I thought it \r\nmight be £15 or even £20; but £100 surpasses all belief.&nbsp; Carrie and I both \r\nrejoiced over our good fortune.&nbsp; Lupin came home in the evening in the \r\nutmost good spirits.&nbsp; I sent Sarah quietly round to the grocer’s for a \r\nbottle of champagne, the same as we had before, “Jackson Frères.”&nbsp; It was \r\nopened at supper, and I said to Lupin: “This is to celebrate some good news I \r\nhave received to-day.”&nbsp; Lupin replied: “Hooray, Guv.!&nbsp; And I have some \r\ngood news, also; a double event, eh?”&nbsp; I said: “My boy, as a result of \r\ntwenty-one years’ industry and strict attention to the interests of my superiors \r\nin office, I have been rewarded with promotion and a rise in salary of \r\n£100.”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin gave three cheers, and we rapped the table furiously, which brought in \r\nSarah to see what the matter was.&nbsp; Lupin ordered us to “fill up” again, and \r\naddressing us upstanding, said: “Having been in the firm of Job Cleanands, stock \r\nand share-brokers, a few weeks, and not having paid particular attention to the \r\ninterests of my superiors in office, my Guv’nor, as a reward to me, allotted me \r\n£5 worth of shares in a really good thing.&nbsp; The result is, to-day I have \r\nmade £200.”&nbsp; I said: “Lupin, you are joking.”&nbsp; “No, Guv., it’s the \r\ngood old truth; Job Cleanands <I>put me on to Chlorates</I>.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>January</SPAN> 21<P class=check>I am very much concerned at Lupin having \r\nstarted a pony-trap.&nbsp; I said: “Lupin, are you justified in this outrageous \r\nextravagance?”&nbsp; Lupin replied: “Well, one must get to the City \r\nsomehow.&nbsp; I’ve only hired it, and can give it up any time I like.”&nbsp; I \r\nrepeated my question: “Are you justified in this extravagance?”&nbsp; He \r\nreplied: “Look here, Guv., excuse me saying so, but you’re a bit out of \r\ndate.&nbsp; It does not pay nowadays, fiddling about over small things.&nbsp; I \r\ndon’t mean anything personal, Guv’nor.&nbsp; My boss says if I take his tip, and \r\nstick to big things, I can make big money!”&nbsp; I said I thought the very idea \r\nof speculation most horrifying.&nbsp; Lupin said “It is not speculation, it’s a \r\ndead cert.”&nbsp; I advised him, at all events, not to continue the pony and \r\ncart; but he replied: “I made £200 in one day; now suppose I only make £200 in a \r\nmonth, or put it at £100 a month, which is ridiculously low—why, that is £1,250 \r\na year.&nbsp; What’s a few pounds a week for a trap?”</P>\r\n<P>I did not pursue the subject further, beyond saying that I should feel glad \r\nwhen the autumn came, and Lupin would be of age and responsible for his own \r\ndebts.&nbsp; He answered: “My dear Guv., I promise you faithfully that I will \r\nnever speculate with what I have not got.&nbsp; I shall only go on Job \r\nCleanands’ tips, and as he is in the ‘know’ it is pretty safe sailing.”&nbsp; I \r\nfelt somewhat relieved.&nbsp; Gowing called in the evening and, to my surprise, \r\ninformed me that, as he had made £10 by one of Lupin’s tips, he intended asking \r\nus and the Cummings round next Saturday.&nbsp; Carrie and I said we should be \r\ndelighted.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>January</SPAN> 22<P class=check>I don’t generally lose my temper with \r\nservants; but I had to speak to Sarah rather sharply about a careless habit she \r\nhas recently contracted of shaking the table-cloth, after removing the breakfast \r\nthings, in a manner which causes all the crumbs to fall on the carpet, \r\neventually to be trodden in.&nbsp; Sarah answered very rudely: “Oh, you are \r\nalways complaining.”&nbsp; I replied: “Indeed, I am not.&nbsp; I spoke to you \r\nlast week about walking all over the drawing-room carpet with a piece of yellow \r\nsoap on the heel of your boot.”&nbsp; She said: “And you’re always grumbling \r\nabout your breakfast.”&nbsp; I said: “No, I am not; but I feel perfectly \r\njustified in complaining that I never can get a hard-boiled egg.&nbsp; The \r\nmoment I crack the shell it spurts all over the plate, and I have spoken to you \r\nat least fifty times about it.”&nbsp; She began to cry and make a scene; but \r\nfortunately my ’bus came by, so I had a good excuse for leaving her.&nbsp; \r\nGowing left a message in the evening, that we were not to forget next \r\nSaturday.&nbsp;

He said: “Oh, nothing, \r\nexcept that I have been on my back for a couple of weeks, that’s all.&nbsp; At \r\none time my doctor nearly gave me up, yet not a soul has come near me.&nbsp; No \r\none has even taken the trouble to inquire whether I was alive or dead.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “This is the first I have heard of it.&nbsp; I have passed your house \r\nseveral nights, and presumed you had company, as the rooms were so brilliantly \r\nlighted.”</P>\r\n<P>Cummings replied: “No!&nbsp; The only company I have had was my wife, the \r\ndoctor, and the landlady—the last-named having turned out a perfect trump.&nbsp; \r\nI wonder you did not see it in the paper.&nbsp; I know it was mentioned in the \r\n<I>Bicycle News</I>.”</P>\r\n<P>I thought to cheer him up, and said: “Well, you are all right now?”</P>\r\n<P>He replied: “That’s not the question.&nbsp; The question is whether an \r\nillness does not enable you to discover who are your <I>true</I> friends.”</P>\r\n<P>I said such an observation was unworthy of him.&nbsp; To make matters worse, \r\nin came Gowing, who gave Cummings a violent slap on the back, and said: \r\n“Hulloh!&nbsp; Have you seen a ghost?&nbsp; You look scared to death, like \r\nIrving in <I>Macbeth</I>.”&nbsp; I said: “Gently, Gowing, the poor fellow has \r\nbeen very ill.”&nbsp; Gowing roared with laughter and said: “Yes, and you look \r\nit, too.”&nbsp; Cummings quietly said: “Yes, and I feel it too—not that I \r\nsuppose you care.”</P>\r\n<P>An awkward silence followed.&nbsp; Gowing said: “Never mind, Cummings, you \r\nand the missis come round to my place to-morrow, and it will cheer you up a bit; \r\nfor we’ll open a bottle of wine.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>January</SPAN> 26<P class=check>An extraordinary thing happened.&nbsp; \r\nCarrie and I went round to Gowing’s, as arranged, at half-past seven.&nbsp;

What do you want?” I said: “Mr. Gowing, he is expecting us.”&nbsp; The \r\nman said (as well as I could hear, owing to the yapping of a little dog): “I \r\ndon’t think he is.&nbsp; Mr. Gowing is not at home.”&nbsp; I said: “He will be \r\nin directly.”</P>\r\n<P>With that observation he slammed the door, leaving Carrie and me standing on \r\nthe steps with a cutting wind blowing round the corner.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie advised me to knock again.&nbsp; I did so, and then discovered for the \r\nfirst time that the knocker had been newly painted, and the paint had come off \r\non my gloves—which were, in consequence, completely spoiled.</P>\r\n<P>I knocked at the door with my stick two or three times.</P>\r\n<P>The man opened the door, taking the chain off this time, and began abusing \r\nme.&nbsp; He said: “What do you mean by scratching the paint with your stick \r\nlike that, spoiling the varnish?&nbsp; You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Pardon me, Mr. Gowing invited—”</P>\r\n<P>He interrupted and said: “I don’t care for Mr. Gowing, or any of his \r\nfriends.&nbsp; This is <I>my</I> door, not Mr. Gowing’s.&nbsp; There are people \r\nhere besides Mr. Gowing.”</P>\r\n<P>The impertinence of this man was nothing.&nbsp; I scarcely noticed it, it was \r\nso trivial in comparison with the scandalous conduct of Gowing.</P>\r\n<P>At this moment Cummings and his wife arrived.&nbsp; Cummings was very lame \r\nand leaning on a stick; but got up the steps and asked what the matter was.</P>\r\n<P>The man said: “Mr. Gowing said nothing about expecting anyone.&nbsp; All he \r\nsaid was he had just received an invitation to Croydon, and he should not be \r\nback till Monday evening.&nbsp;

he flicked at the \r\nhorse of an old man who was riding, causing it to rear; and, as I had to ride \r\nbackwards, I was compelled to face a gang of roughs in a donkey-cart, whom Lupin \r\nhad chaffed, and who turned and followed us for nearly a mile, bellowing, \r\nindulging in coarse jokes and laughter, to say nothing of occasionally pelting \r\nus with orange-peel.</P>\r\n<P>Lupin’s excuse—that the Prince of Wales would have to put up with the same \r\nsort of thing if he drove to the Derby—was of little consolation to either \r\nCarrie or myself.&nbsp;

I was this morning trying to look at it \r\nby the aid of a small hand-glass, when somehow my elbow caught against the edge \r\nof the chest of drawers and knocked the glass out of my hand and smashed \r\nit.&nbsp; Carrie was in an awful way about it, as she is rather absurdly \r\nsuperstitious.&nbsp; To make matters worse, my large photograph in the \r\ndrawing-room fell during the night, and the glass cracked.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie said: “Mark my words, Charles, some misfortune is about to \r\nhappen.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Nonsense, dear.”</P>\r\n<P>In the evening Lupin arrived home early, and seemed a little agitated.&nbsp; \r\nI said: “What’s up, my boy?”&nbsp; He hesitated a good deal, and then said: “You \r\nknow those Parachikka Chlorates I advised you to invest £20 in?”&nbsp; I \r\nreplied: “Yes, they are all right, I trust?”&nbsp; He replied: “Well, no!&nbsp; \r\nTo the surprise of everybody, they have utterly collapsed.”</P>\r\n<P>My breath was so completely taken away, I could say nothing.&nbsp; Carrie \r\nlooked at me, and said: “What did I tell you?”&nbsp; Lupin, after a while, said: \r\n“However, you are specially fortunate.&nbsp; I received an early tip, and sold \r\nout yours immediately, and was fortunate to get £2 for them.&nbsp; So you get \r\nsomething after all.”</P>\r\n<P>I gave a sigh of relief.&nbsp; I said: “I was not so sanguine as to suppose, \r\nas you predicted, that I should get six or eight times the amount of my \r\ninvestment; still a profit of £2 is a good percentage for such a short \r\ntime.”&nbsp; Lupin said, quite irritably: “You don’t understand.&nbsp; I sold \r\nyour £20 shares for £2; you therefore lose £18 on the transaction, whereby \r\nCummings and Gowing will lose the whole of theirs.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>February</SPAN> 19<P class=check>Lupin, before going to town, said: “I \r\nam very sorry about those Parachikka Chlorates;

Neither Lupin nor I broached the subject to him, but he \r\ndid so of his own accord.&nbsp; He said: “I say, those Parachikka Chlorates have \r\ngone an awful smash!&nbsp; You’re a nice one, Master Lupin.&nbsp; How much do \r\nyou lose?”&nbsp; Lupin, to my utter astonishment, said: “Oh!&nbsp; I had nothing \r\nin them.&nbsp; There was some informality in my application—I forgot to enclose \r\nthe cheque or something, and I didn’t get any.&nbsp; The Guv. loses £18.”&nbsp; \r\nI said: “I quite understood you were in it, or nothing would have induced me to \r\nspeculate.”&nbsp; Lupin replied: “Well, it can’t be helped; you must go double \r\non the next tip.”&nbsp; Before I could reply, Gowing said: “Well, I lose \r\nnothing, fortunately.&nbsp; From what I heard, I did not quite believe in them, \r\nso I persuaded Cummings to take my £15 worth, as he had more faith in them than \r\nI had.”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin burst out laughing, and, in the most unseemly manner, said: “Alas, poor \r\nCummings.&nbsp; He’ll lose £35.”&nbsp; At that moment there was a ring at the \r\nbell.&nbsp; Lupin said: “I don’t want to meet Cummings.”&nbsp; If he had gone \r\nout of the door he would have met him in the passage, so as quickly as possible \r\nLupin opened the parlour window and got out.&nbsp; Gowing jumped up suddenly, \r\nexclaiming: “I don’t want to see him either!” and, before I could say a word, he \r\nfollowed Lupin out of the window.</P>\r\n<P>For my own part, I was horrified to think my own son and one of my most \r\nintimate friends should depart from the house like a couple of interrupted \r\nburglars.&nbsp; Poor Cummings was very upset, and of course was naturally very \r\nangry both with Lupin and Gowing.&nbsp; I pressed him to have a little whisky, \r\nand he replied that he had given up whisky; but would like a little \r\n“Unsweetened,” as he was advised it was the most healthy spirit.&nbsp; I had \r\nnone in the house, but sent Sarah round to Lockwood’s for some.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>February</SPAN> 20<P class=check>The first thing that caught my eye on \r\nopening the <I>Standard</I> was—“Great Failure of Stock and Share Dealers!&nbsp;

Lupin \r\nsaid: “How did you know? who told you?”&nbsp; I handed him the \r\n<I>Standard</I>.&nbsp; He threw the paper down, and said: “Oh I don’t care a \r\nbutton for that!&nbsp; I expected that, but I did not expect this.”&nbsp; He \r\nthen read a letter from Frank Mutlar, announcing, in a cool manner, that Daisy \r\nMutlar is to be married next month to Murray Posh.&nbsp; I exclaimed, “Murray \r\nPosh!&nbsp; Is not that the very man Frank had the impudence to bring here last \r\nTuesday week?”&nbsp;

<I>I</I> don’t think either of them \r\nis.&nbsp; In the evening Gowing called, and the chief topic of conversation was \r\nDaisy’s marriage to Murray Posh.&nbsp; I said: “I was glad the matter was at an \r\nend, as Daisy would only have made a fool of Lupin.”&nbsp;

My great dream of the last few \r\nweeks—in fact, of many years—has been realised.&nbsp; This morning came a letter \r\nfrom Mr. Perkupp, asking me to take Lupin down to the office with me.&nbsp; I \r\nwent to Lupin’s room; poor fellow, he seemed very pale, and said he had a bad \r\nheadache.&nbsp; He had come back yesterday from Gravesend, where he spent part \r\nof the day in a small boat on the water, having been mad enough to neglect to \r\ntake his overcoat with him.&nbsp; I showed him Mr. Perkupp’s letter, and he got \r\nup as quickly as possible.&nbsp; I begged of him not to put on his fast-coloured \r\nclothes and ties, but to dress in something black or quiet-looking.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie was all of a tremble when she read the letter, and all she could keep \r\non saying was: “Oh, I <I>do</I> hope it will be all right.”&nbsp; For myself, I \r\ncould scarcely eat any breakfast.&nbsp; Lupin came down dressed quietly, and \r\nlooking a perfect gentleman, except that his face was rather yellow.&nbsp; \r\nCarrie, by way of encouragement said: “You do look nice, Lupin.”&nbsp; Lupin \r\nreplied: “Yes, it’s a good make-up, isn’t it?&nbsp; A \r\nregular-downright-respectable-funereal-first-class-City-firm-junior-clerk.”&nbsp; \r\nHe laughed rather ironically.</P>\r\n<P>In the hall I heard a great noise, and also Lupin shouting to Sarah to fetch \r\ndown his old hat.&nbsp; I went into the passage, and found Lupin in a fury, \r\nkicking and smashing a new tall hat.&nbsp; I said: “Lupin, my boy, what are you \r\ndoing?&nbsp; How wicked of you!&nbsp; Some poor fellow would be glad to have \r\nit.”&nbsp; Lupin replied: “I would not insult any poor fellow by giving it to \r\nhim.”</P>\r\n<P>When he had gone outside, I picked up the battered hat, and saw inside \r\n“Posh’s Patent.”&nbsp; Poor Lupin!&nbsp; I can forgive him.&nbsp; It seemed \r\nhours before we reached the office.&nbsp; Mr. Perkupp sent for Lupin, who was \r\nwith him nearly an hour.&nbsp; He returned, as I thought, crestfallen in \r\nappearance.&nbsp; I said: “Well, Lupin, how about Mr. Perkupp?”&nbsp; Lupin \r\ncommenced his song: “What’s the matter with Perkupp?&nbsp; He’s all \r\nright!”&nbsp; I felt instinctively my boy was engaged.&nbsp; I went to Mr. \r\nPerkupp, but I could not speak.&nbsp; He said: “Well, Mr. Pooter, what is \r\nit?”&nbsp; I must have looked a fool, for all I could say was: “Mr. Perkupp, you \r\nare a good man.”&nbsp; He looked at me for a moment, and said: “No, Mr. Pooter, \r\n<I>you</I> are the good man; and we’ll see if we cannot get your son to follow \r\nsuch an excellent example.”&nbsp; I said: “Mr. Perkupp, may I go home?&nbsp; I \r\ncannot work any more to-day.”</P>\r\n<P>My good master shook my hand warmly as he nodded his head.&nbsp; It was as \r\nmuch as I could do to prevent myself from crying in the ’bus; in fact, I should \r\nhave done so, had my thoughts not been interrupted by Lupin, who was having a \r\nquarrel with a fat man in the ’bus, whom he accused of taking up too much \r\nroom.</P>\r\n<P>In the evening Carrie sent round for dear old friend Cummings and his wife, \r\nand also to Gowing.&nbsp; We all sat round the fire, and in a bottle of “Jackson \r\nFrères,” which Sarah fetched from the grocer’s, drank Lupin’s health.&nbsp; I \r\nlay awake for hours, thinking of the future.&nbsp; My boy in the same office as \r\nmyself—we can go down together by the ’bus, come home together, and who knows \r\nbut in the course of time he may take great interest in our little home.&nbsp; \r\nThat he may help me to put a nail in here or a nail in there, or help his dear \r\nmother to hang a picture.&nbsp; In the summer he may help us in our little \r\ngarden with the flowers, and assist us to paint the stands and pots.&nbsp; \r\n(By-the-by, I must get in some more enamel paint.)&nbsp; All this I thought over \r\nand over again, and a thousand happy thoughts beside.&nbsp; I heard the clock \r\nstrike four, and soon after fell asleep, only to dream of three happy \r\npeople—Lupin, dear Carrie, and myself.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter XVIII</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Trouble with a stylographic pen.&nbsp;

It has caused me constant annoyance and irritability of temper.&nbsp; \r\nThe ink oozes out of the top, making a mess on my hands, and once at the office \r\nwhen I was knocking the palm of my hand on the desk to jerk the ink down, Mr. \r\nPerkupp, who had just entered, called out: “Stop that knocking!&nbsp; I suppose \r\nthat is you, Mr. Pitt?”&nbsp; That young monkey, Pitt, took a malicious glee in \r\nresponding quite loudly: “No, sir; I beg pardon, it is Mr. Pooter with his pen; \r\nit has been going on all the morning.”&nbsp; To make matters worse, I saw Lupin \r\nlaughing behind his desk.&nbsp; I thought it wiser to say nothing.&nbsp; I took \r\nthe pen back to the shop and asked them if they would take it back, as it did \r\nnot act.&nbsp; I did not expect the full price returned, but was willing to take \r\nhalf.&nbsp; The man said he could not do that—buying and selling were two \r\ndifferent things.&nbsp; Lupin’s conduct during the period he has been in Mr. \r\nPerkupp’s office has been most exemplary.&nbsp;

We accepted of his \r\nkindness, and he stayed to supper, an occasion I thought suitable for trying a \r\nbottle of the sparkling Algéra that Mr. James (of Sutton) had sent as a \r\npresent.&nbsp; Gowing sipped the wine, observing that he had never tasted it \r\nbefore, and further remarked that his policy was to stick to more recognised \r\nbrands.&nbsp; I told him it was a present from a dear friend, and one mustn’t \r\nlook a gift-horse in the mouth.&nbsp; Gowing facetiously replied: “And he didn’t \r\nlike putting it in the mouth either.”</P>\r\n<P>I thought the remarks were rude without being funny, but on tasting it \r\nmyself, came to the conclusion there was some justification for them.&nbsp; The \r\nsparkling Algéra is very like cider, only more sour.&nbsp; I suggested that \r\nperhaps the thunder had turned it a bit acid.&nbsp; He merely replied: “Oh! I \r\ndon’t think so.”&nbsp; We had a very pleasant game of cards, though I lost four \r\nshillings and Carrie lost one, and Gowing said he had lost about sixpence: how \r\nhe could have lost, considering that Carrie and I were the only other players, \r\nremains a mystery.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 14<br>Sunday<P class=check>Owing, I presume, to the unsettled \r\nweather, I awoke with a feeling that my skin was drawn over my face as tight as \r\na drum.&nbsp;

On my advice, Carrie put on the same dress that she looked so \r\nbeautiful in at the Mansion House, for it had occurred to me, being a military \r\nball, that Mr. Perkupp, who, I believe, is an officer in the Honorary Artillery \r\nCompany, would in all probability be present.&nbsp; Lupin, in his usual \r\nincomprehensible language, remarked that he had heard it was a “bounders’ \r\nball.”&nbsp; I didn’t ask him what he meant though I didn’t understand.&nbsp; \r\nWhere he gets these expressions from I don’t know; he certainly doesn’t learn \r\nthem at home.</P>\r\n<P>The invitation was for half-past eight, so I concluded if we arrived an hour \r\nlater we should be in good time, without being “unfashionable,” as Mrs. James \r\nsays.&nbsp; It was very difficult to find—the cabman having to get down several \r\ntimes to inquire at different public-houses where the Drill Hall was.&nbsp; I \r\nwonder at people living in such out-of-the-way places.&nbsp; No one seemed to \r\nknow it.&nbsp; However, after going up and down a good many badly-lighted \r\nstreets we arrived at our destination.&nbsp; I had no idea it was so far from \r\nHolloway.&nbsp; I gave the cabman five shillings, who only grumbled, saying it \r\nwas dirt cheap at half-a-sovereign, and was impertinent enough to advise me the \r\nnext time I went to a ball to take a ’bus.</P>\r\n<P>Captain Welcut received us, saying we were rather late, but that it was \r\nbetter late than never.&nbsp; He seemed a very good-looking gentleman though, as \r\nCarrie remarked, “rather short for an officer.”&nbsp; He begged to be excused \r\nfor leaving us, as he was engaged for a dance, and hoped we should make \r\nourselves at home.&nbsp; Carrie took my arm and we walked round the rooms two or \r\nthree times and watched the people dancing.&nbsp; I couldn’t find a single \r\nperson I knew, but attributed it to most of them being in uniform.&nbsp; As we \r\nwere entering the supper-room I received a slap on the shoulder, followed by a \r\nwelcome shake of the hand.&nbsp; I said: “Mr. Padge, I believe;” he replied, \r\n“That’s right.”</P>\r\n<P>I gave Carrie a chair, and seated by her was a lady who made herself at home \r\nwith Carrie at once.</P>\r\n<P>There was a very liberal repast on the tables, plenty of champagne, claret, \r\netc., and, in fact, everything seemed to be done regardless of expense.&nbsp; \r\nMr. Padge is a man that, I admit, I have no particular liking for, but I felt so \r\nglad to come across someone I knew, that I asked him to sit at our table, and I \r\nmust say that for a short fat man he looked well in uniform, although I think \r\nhis tunic was rather baggy in the back.&nbsp; It was the only supper-room that I \r\nhave been in that was not over-crowded; in fact we were the only people there, \r\neverybody being so busy dancing.</P>\r\n<P>I assisted Carrie and her newly-formed acquaintance, who said her name was \r\nLupkin, to some champagne; also myself, and handed the bottle to Mr. Padge to do \r\nlikewise, saying: “You must look after yourself.”&nbsp; He replied: “That’s \r\nright,” and poured out half a tumbler and drank Carrie’s health, coupled, as he \r\nsaid, “with her worthy lord and master.”&nbsp; We all had some splendid pigeon \r\npie, and ices to follow.</P>\r\n<P>The waiters were very attentive, and asked if we would like some more \r\nwine.&nbsp; I assisted Carrie and her friend and Mr. Padge, also some people who \r\nhad just come from the dancing-room, who were very civil.&nbsp; It occurred to \r\nme at the time that perhaps some of the gentlemen knew me in the City, as they \r\nwere so polite.&nbsp; I made myself useful, and assisted several ladies to ices, \r\nremembering an old saying that “There is nothing lost by civility.”</P>\r\n<P>The band struck up for the dance, and they all went into the ball-room.&nbsp; \r\nThe ladies (Carrie and Mrs. Lupkin) were anxious to see the dancing, and as I \r\nhad not quite finished my supper, Mr. Padge offered his arms to them and \r\nescorted them to the ball-room, telling me to follow.&nbsp; I said to Mr. Padge: \r\n“It is quite a West End affair,” to which remark Mr. Padge replied: “That’s \r\nright.”</P>\r\n<P>When I had quite finished my supper, and was leaving, the waiter who had been \r\nattending on us arrested my attention by tapping me on the shoulder.&nbsp; I \r\nthought it unusual for a waiter at a private ball to expect a tip, but \r\nnevertheless gave a shilling, as he had been very attentive.&nbsp; He smilingly \r\nreplied: “I beg your pardon, sir, this is no good,” alluding to the \r\nshilling.&nbsp; “Your party’s had four suppers at 5s. a head, five ices at 1s., \r\nthree bottles of champagne at 11s. 6d., a glass of claret, and a sixpenny cigar \r\nfor the stout gentleman—in all £3 0s. 6d.!”</P>\r\n<P>I don’t think I was ever so surprised in my life, and had only sufficient \r\nbreath to inform him that I had received a private invitation, to which he \r\nanswered that he was perfectly well aware of that; but that the invitation \r\ndidn’t include eatables and drinkables.&nbsp; A gentleman who was standing at \r\nthe bar corroborated the waiter’s statement, and assured me it was quite \r\ncorrect.</P>\r\n<P>The waiter said he was extremely sorry if I had been under any \r\nmisapprehension; but it was not his fault.&nbsp; Of course there was nothing to \r\nbe done but to pay.&nbsp; So, after turning out my pockets, I just managed to \r\nscrape up sufficient, all but nine shillings; but the manager, on my giving my \r\ncard to him, said: “That’s all right.”</P>\r\n<P>I don’t think I ever felt more humiliated in my life, and I determined to \r\nkeep this misfortune from Carrie, for it would entirely destroy the pleasant \r\nevening she was enjoying.&nbsp; I felt there was no more enjoyment for me that \r\nevening, and it being late, I sought Carrie and Mrs. Lupkin.&nbsp; Carrie said \r\nshe was quite ready to go, and Mrs. Lupkin, as we were wishing her “Good-night,” \r\nasked Carrie and myself if we ever paid a visit to Southend?&nbsp; On my \r\nreplying that I hadn’t been there for many years, she very kindly said: “Well, \r\nwhy don’t you come down and stay at our place?”&nbsp; As her invitation was so \r\npressing, and observing that Carrie wished to go, we promised we would visit her \r\nthe next Saturday week, and stay till Monday.&nbsp; Mrs. Lupkin said she would \r\nwrite to us to-morrow, giving us the address and particulars of trains, etc.</P>\r\n<P>When we got outside the Drill Hall it was raining so hard that the roads \r\nresembled canals, and I need hardly say we had great difficulty in getting a \r\ncabman to take us to Holloway.&nbsp; After waiting a bit, a man said he would \r\ndrive us, anyhow, as far as “The Angel,” at Islington, and we could easily get \r\nanother cab from there.&nbsp; It was a tedious journey; the rain was beating \r\nagainst the windows and trickling down the inside of the cab.</P>\r\n<P>When we arrived at “The Angel” the horse seemed tired out.&nbsp; Carrie got \r\nout and ran into a doorway, and when I came to pay, to my absolute horror I \r\nremembered I had no money, nor had Carrie.&nbsp; I explained to the cabman how \r\nwe were situated.&nbsp; Never in my life have I ever been so insulted; the \r\ncabman, who was a rough bully and to my thinking not sober, called me every name \r\nhe could lay his tongue to, and positively seized me by the beard, which he \r\npulled till the tears came into my eyes.&nbsp; I took the number of a policeman \r\n(who witnessed the assault) for not taking the man in charge.&nbsp; The \r\npoliceman said he couldn’t interfere, that he had seen no assault, and that \r\npeople should not ride in cabs without money.</P>\r\n<P>We had to walk home in the pouring rain, nearly two miles, and when I got in \r\nI put down the conversation I had with the cabman, word for word, as I intend \r\nwriting to the <I>Telegraph</I> for the purpose of proposing that cabs should be \r\ndriven only by men under Government control, to prevent civilians being \r\nsubjected to the disgraceful insult and outrage that I had had to endure.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 17<P class=check>No water in our cistern again.&nbsp;

and in pulling the door hard, to give it an \r\nextra slam, the handle came off in his hands, and he fell backwards \r\ndownstairs.</P>\r\n<P>On hearing this, Lupin suddenly jumped up from the couch and rushed out of \r\nthe room sideways.&nbsp; Cummings looked very indignant, and remarked it was \r\nvery poor fun a man nearly breaking his back; and though I had my suspicions \r\nthat Lupin was laughing, I assured Cummings that he had only run out to open the \r\ndoor to a friend he expected.&nbsp; Cummings said this was the second time he \r\nhad been laid up, and we had never sent to inquire.&nbsp; I said I knew nothing \r\nabout it.&nbsp; Cummings said: “It was mentioned in the <I>Bicycle \r\nNews</I>.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 22<P class=check>I have of late frequently noticed Carrie \r\nrubbing her nails a good deal with an instrument, and on asking her what she was \r\ndoing, she replied: “Oh, I’m going in for manicuring.&nbsp;

\r\nThat’s a face I know.”&nbsp; I replied politely: “Very likely; lots of people \r\nknow me, although I may not know them.”&nbsp; He replied: “But you know me—Teddy \r\nFinsworth.”&nbsp; So it was.&nbsp; He was at the same school with me.&nbsp; I \r\nhad not seen him for years and years.&nbsp; No wonder I did not know him!&nbsp; \r\nAt school he was at least a head taller than I was; now I am at least a head \r\ntaller than he is, and he has a thick beard, almost grey.&nbsp; He insisted on \r\nmy having a glass of wine (a thing I never do), and told me he lived at \r\nMiddlesboro’, where he was Deputy Town Clerk, a position which was as high as \r\nthe Town Clerk of London—in fact, higher.&nbsp; He added that he was staying for \r\na few days in London, with his uncle, Mr. Edgar Paul Finsworth (of Finsworth and \r\nPultwell).&nbsp; He said he was sure his uncle would be only too pleased to see \r\nme, and he had a nice house, Watney Lodge, only a few minutes’ walk from Muswell \r\nHill Station.&nbsp; I gave him our address, and we parted.</P>\r\n<P>In the evening, to my surprise, he called with a very nice letter from Mr. \r\nFinsworth, saying if we (including Carrie) would dine with them to-morrow \r\n(Sunday), at two o’clock, he would be delighted.&nbsp; Carrie did not like to \r\ngo; but Teddy Finsworth pressed us so much we consented.&nbsp; Carrie sent Sarah \r\nround to the butcher’s and countermanded our half-leg of mutton, which we had \r\nordered for to-morrow.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 28<br>Sunday<P class=check>We found Watney Lodge farther off \r\nthan we anticipated, and only arrived as the clock struck two, both feeling hot \r\nand uncomfortable.&nbsp; To make matters worse, a large collie dog pounced \r\nforward to receive us.&nbsp; He barked loudly and jumped up at Carrie, covering \r\nher light skirt, which she was wearing for the first time, with mud.&nbsp; Teddy \r\nFinsworth came out and drove the dog off and apologised.&nbsp; We were shown \r\ninto the drawing-room, which was beautifully decorated.&nbsp; It was full of \r\nknick-knacks, and some plates hung up on the wall.&nbsp; There were several \r\nlittle wooden milk-stools with paintings on them; also a white wooden banjo, \r\npainted by one of Mr. Paul Finsworth’s nieces—a cousin of Teddy’s.</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Paul Finsworth seemed quite a distinguished-looking elderly gentleman, \r\nand was most gallant to Carrie.&nbsp; There were a great many water-colours \r\nhanging on the walls, mostly different views of India, which were very \r\nbright.&nbsp; Mr. Finsworth said they were painted by “Simpz,” and added that he \r\nwas no judge of pictures himself but had been informed on good authority that \r\nthey were worth some hundreds of pounds, although he had only paid a few \r\nshillings apiece for them, frames included, at a sale in the neighbourhood.</P>\r\n<P>There was also a large picture in a very handsome frame, done in coloured \r\ncrayons.&nbsp; It looked like a religious subject.&nbsp; I was very much struck \r\nwith the lace collar, it looked so real, but I unfortunately made the remark \r\nthat there was something about the expression of the face that was not quite \r\npleasing.&nbsp; It looked pinched.&nbsp; Mr. Finsworth sorrowfully replied: \r\n“Yes, the face was done after death—my wife’s sister.”</P>\r\n<P>I felt terribly awkward and bowed apologetically, and in a whisper said I \r\nhoped I had not hurt his feelings.&nbsp; We both stood looking at the picture \r\nfor a few minutes in silence, when Mr. Finsworth took out a handkerchief and \r\nsaid: “She was sitting in our garden last summer,” and blew his nose \r\nviolently.&nbsp; He seemed quite affected, so I turned to look at something else \r\nand stood in front of a portrait of a jolly-looking middle-aged gentleman, with \r\na red face and straw hat.&nbsp; I said to Mr. Finsworth: “Who is this \r\njovial-looking gentleman?&nbsp; Life doesn’t seem to trouble him much.”&nbsp; \r\nMr. Finsworth said: “No, it doesn’t.&nbsp; <I>He is dead too</I>—my \r\nbrother.”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=90% src="19_1.gif"><br>“He is dead too.”</P>\r\n<P>I was absolutely horrified at my own awkwardness.&nbsp; Fortunately at this \r\nmoment Carrie entered with Mrs. Finsworth, who had taken her upstairs to take \r\noff her bonnet and brush her skirt.&nbsp; Teddy said: “Short is late,” but at \r\nthat moment the gentleman referred to arrived, and I was introduced to him by \r\nTeddy, who said: “Do you know Mr. Short?”&nbsp; I replied, smiling, that I had \r\nnot that pleasure, but I hoped it would not be long before I knew Mr. \r\n<I>Short</I>.&nbsp; He evidently did not see my little joke, although I repeated \r\nit twice with a little laugh.&nbsp; I suddenly remembered it was Sunday, and Mr. \r\nShort was perhaps <I>very particular</I>.&nbsp; In this I was mistaken, for he \r\nwas not at all particular in several of his remarks after dinner.&nbsp; In fact \r\nI was so ashamed of one of his observations that I took the opportunity to say \r\nto Mrs. Finsworth that I feared she found Mr. Short occasionally a little \r\nembarrassing.&nbsp; To my surprise she said: “Oh! he is privileged you \r\nknow.”&nbsp; I did not know as a matter of fact, and so I bowed \r\napologetically.&nbsp; I fail to see why Mr. Short should be privileged.</P>\r\n<P>Another thing that annoyed me at dinner was that the collie dog, which jumped \r\nup at Carrie, was allowed to remain under the dining-room table.&nbsp; It kept \r\ngrowling and snapping at my boots every time I moved my foot.&nbsp; Feeling \r\nnervous rather, I spoke to Mrs. Finsworth about the animal, and she remarked: \r\n“It is only his play.”&nbsp; She jumped up and let in a frightfully ugly-looking \r\nspaniel called Bibbs, which had been scratching at the door.&nbsp; This dog also \r\nseemed to take a fancy to my boots, and I discovered afterwards that it had \r\nlicked off every bit of blacking from them.&nbsp; I was positively ashamed of \r\nbeing seen in them.&nbsp; Mrs. Finsworth, who, I must say, is not much of a \r\nJob’s comforter, said: “Oh! we are used to Bibbs doing that to our \r\nvisitors.”</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Finsworth had up some fine port, although I question whether it is a good \r\nthing to take on the top of beer.&nbsp; It made me feel a little sleepy, while \r\nit had the effect of inducing Mr. Short to become “privileged” to rather an \r\nalarming extent.&nbsp; It being cold even for April, there was a fire in the \r\ndrawing-room; we sat round in easy-chairs, and Teddy and I waxed rather eloquent \r\nover the old school days, which had the effect of sending all the others to \r\nsleep.&nbsp; I was delighted, as far as Mr. Short was concerned, that it did \r\nhave that effect on him.</P>\r\n<P>We stayed till four, and the walk home was remarkable only for the fact that \r\nseveral fools giggled at the unpolished state of my boots.&nbsp; Polished them \r\nmyself when I got home.&nbsp; Went to church in the evening, and could scarcely \r\nkeep awake.&nbsp; I will not take port on the top of beer again.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>April</SPAN> 29<P class=check>I am getting quite accustomed to being \r\nsnubbed by Lupin, and I do not mind being sat upon by Carrie, because I think \r\nshe has a certain amount of right to do so;

I dreamt I saw some huge blocks of ice in a shop with \r\na bright glare behind them.&nbsp; I walked into the shop and the heat was \r\noverpowering.&nbsp; I found that the blocks of ice were on fire.&nbsp; The whole \r\nthing was so real and yet so supernatural I woke up in a cold \r\nperspiration.&nbsp; Lupin in a most contemptuous manner, said: “What utter \r\nrot.”</P>\r\n<P>Before I could reply, Gowing said there was nothing so completely \r\nuninteresting as other people’s dreams.</P>\r\n<P>I appealed to Cummings, but he said he was bound to agree with the others and \r\nmy dream was especially nonsensical.&nbsp; I said: “It seemed so real to \r\nme.”&nbsp; Gowing replied: “Yes, to <I>you</I> perhaps, but not to \r\n<I>us</I>.”&nbsp; Whereupon they all roared.</P>\r\n<P>Carrie, who had hitherto been quiet, said: “He tells me his stupid dreams \r\nevery morning nearly.”&nbsp; I replied: “Very well, dear, I promise you I will \r\nnever tell you or anybody else another dream of mine the longest day I \r\nlive.”&nbsp; Lupin said: “Hear! hear!” and helped himself to another glass of \r\nbeer.&nbsp; The subject was fortunately changed, and Cummings read a most \r\ninteresting article on the superiority of the bicycle to the horse.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter XX</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Dinner at Franching’s to meet Mr. Hardfur Huttle.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>May</SPAN> 10<P class=check>Received a letter from Mr. Franching, of \r\nPeckham, asking us to dine with him to-night, at seven o’clock, to meet Mr. \r\nHardfur Huttle, a very clever writer for the American papers.&nbsp; Franching \r\napologised for the short notice; but said he had at the last moment been \r\ndisappointed of two of his guests and regarded us as old friends who would not \r\nmind filling up the gap.&nbsp; Carrie rather demurred at the invitation; but I \r\nexplained to her that Franching was very well off and influential, and we could \r\nnot afford to offend him.&nbsp; “And we are sure to get a good dinner and a good \r\nglass of champagne.”&nbsp; “Which never agrees with you!” Carrie replied, \r\nsharply.&nbsp; I regarded Carrie’s observation as unsaid.&nbsp; Mr. Franching \r\nasked us to wire a reply.&nbsp; As he had said nothing about dress in the \r\nletter, I wired back: “With pleasure.&nbsp; Is it full dress?” and by leaving \r\nout our name, just got the message within the sixpence.</P>\r\n<P>Got back early to give time to dress, which we received a telegram \r\ninstructing us to do.&nbsp; I wanted Carrie to meet me at Franching’s house; but \r\nshe would not do so, so I had to go home to fetch her.&nbsp; What a long journey \r\nit is from Holloway to Peckham!&nbsp; Why do people live such a long way \r\noff?&nbsp; Having to change ’buses, I allowed plenty of time—in fact, too much; \r\nfor we arrived at twenty minutes to seven, and Franching, so the servant said, \r\nhad only just gone up to dress.&nbsp; However, he was down as the clock struck \r\nseven; he must have dressed very quickly.</P>\r\n<P>I must say it was quite a distinguished party, and although we did not know \r\nanybody personally, they all seemed to be quite swells.&nbsp; Franching had got \r\na professional waiter, and evidently spared no expense.&nbsp; There were flowers \r\non the table round some fairy-lamps and the effect, I must say, was \r\nexquisite.&nbsp; The wine was good and there was plenty of champagne, concerning \r\nwhich Franching said he himself, never wished to taste better.&nbsp; We were ten \r\nin number, and a <I>menû</I> card to each.&nbsp; One lady said she always \r\npreserved the <I>menû</I> and got the guests to write their names on the \r\nback.</P>\r\n<P>We all of us followed her example, except Mr. Huttle, who was of course the \r\nimportant guest.</P>\r\n<P>The dinner-party consisted of Mr. Franching, Mr. Hardfur Huttle, Mr. and Mrs. \r\nSamuel Hillbutter, Mrs. Field, Mr. and Mrs. Purdick, Mr. Pratt, Mr. R. Kent, \r\nand, last but not least, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Pooter.&nbsp; Franching said he \r\nwas sorry he had no lady for me to take in to dinner.&nbsp; I replied that I \r\npreferred it, which I afterwards thought was a very uncomplimentary observation \r\nto make.</P>\r\n<P>I sat next to Mrs. Field at dinner.&nbsp; She seemed a well-informed lady, \r\nbut was very deaf.&nbsp; It did not much matter, for Mr. Hardfur Huttle did all \r\nthe talking.&nbsp; He is a marvellously intellectual man and says things which \r\nfrom other people would seem quite alarming.&nbsp; How I wish I could remember \r\neven a quarter of his brilliant conversation.&nbsp; I made a few little \r\nreminding notes on the <I>menû</I> card.</P>\r\n<P>One observation struck me as being absolutely powerful—though not to my way \r\nof thinking of course.&nbsp; Mrs. Purdick happened to say “You are certainly \r\nunorthodox, Mr. Huttle.”&nbsp; Mr. Huttle, with a peculiar expression (I can see \r\nit now) said in a slow rich voice: “Mrs. Purdick, ‘orthodox’ is a grandiloquent \r\nword implying sticking-in-the-mud.&nbsp; If Columbus and Stephenson had been \r\northodox, there would neither have been the discovery of America nor the \r\nsteam-engine.”&nbsp; There was quite a silence.&nbsp; It appeared to me that \r\nsuch teaching was absolutely dangerous, and yet I felt—in fact we must all have \r\nfelt—there was no answer to the argument.&nbsp; A little later on, Mrs. Purdick, \r\nwho is Franching’s sister and also acted as hostess, rose from the table, and \r\nMr. Huttle said: “Why, ladies, do you deprive us of your company so soon?&nbsp; \r\nWhy not wait while we have our cigars?”</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=90% src="20_1.gif"><br>“‘Orthodox’ is a grandiloquent word.</P>\r\n<P>The effect was electrical.&nbsp; The ladies (including Carrie) were in no way \r\ninclined to be deprived of Mr. Huttle’s fascinating society, and immediately \r\nresumed their seats, amid much laughter and a little chaff.&nbsp; Mr. Huttle \r\nsaid: “Well, that’s a real good sign; you shall not be insulted by being called \r\northodox any longer.”&nbsp; Mrs. Purdick, who seemed to be a bright and rather \r\nsharp woman, said: “Mr. Huttle, we will meet you half-way—that is, till you get \r\nhalf-way through your cigar.&nbsp; That, at all events, will be the happy \r\nmedium.”</P>\r\n<P>I shall never forget the effect the words, “happy medium,” had upon \r\nhim.&nbsp; He was brilliant and most daring in his interpretation of the \r\nwords.&nbsp; He positively alarmed me.&nbsp; He said something like the \r\nfollowing: “Happy medium, indeed.&nbsp; Do you know ‘happy medium’ are two words \r\nwhich mean ‘miserable mediocrity’?&nbsp; I say, go first class or third; marry a \r\nduchess or her kitchenmaid.&nbsp; The happy medium means respectability, and \r\nrespectability means insipidness.&nbsp; Does it not, Mr. Pooter?”</P>\r\n<P>I was so taken aback by being personally appealed to, that I could only bow \r\napologetically, and say I feared I was not competent to offer an opinion.&nbsp; \r\nCarrie was about to say something; but she was interrupted, for which I was \r\nrather pleased, for she is not clever at argument, and one has to be extra \r\nclever to discuss a subject with a man like Mr. Huttle.</P>\r\n<P>He continued, with an amazing eloquence that made his unwelcome opinions \r\npositively convincing: “The happy medium is nothing more or less than a vulgar \r\nhalf-measure.&nbsp; A man who loves champagne and, finding a pint too little, \r\nfears to face a whole bottle and has recourse to an imperial pint, will never \r\nbuild a Brooklyn Bridge or an Eiffel Tower.&nbsp; No, he is half-hearted, he is \r\na half-measure—respectable—in fact, a happy medium, and will spend the rest of \r\nhis days in a suburban villa with a stucco-column portico, resembling a \r\nfour-post bedstead.”</P>\r\n<P>We all laughed.</P>\r\n<P>“That sort of thing,” continued Mr. Huttle, “belongs to a soft man, with a \r\nsoft beard with a soft head, with a made tie that hooks on.”</P>\r\n<P>This seemed rather personal and twice I caught myself looking in the glass of \r\nthe cheffonière; for <I>I</I> had on a tie that hooked on—and why not?&nbsp; If \r\nthese remarks were not personal they were rather careless, and so were some of \r\nhis subsequent observations, which must have made both Mr. Franching and his \r\nguests rather uncomfortable.&nbsp; I don’t think Mr. Huttle meant to be \r\npersonal, for he added; “We don’t know that class here in this country: but we \r\ndo in America, and I’ve no use for them.”</P>\r\n<P>Franching several times suggested that the wine should be passed round the \r\ntable, which Mr. Huttle did not heed; but continued as if he were giving a \r\nlecture:</P>\r\n<P>“What we want in America is your homes.&nbsp; We live on wheels.&nbsp; Your \r\nsimple, quiet life and home, Mr. Franching, are charming.&nbsp; No display, no \r\npretension!&nbsp; You make no difference in your dinner, I dare say, when you \r\nsit down by yourself and when you invite us.&nbsp; You have your own personal \r\nattendant—no hired waiter to breathe on the back of your head.”</P>\r\n<P>I saw Franching palpably wince at this.</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Huttle continued: “Just a small dinner with a few good things, such as \r\nyou have this evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don’t insult your guests by sending to \r\nthe grocer for champagne at six shillings a bottle.”</P>\r\n<P>I could not help thinking of “Jackson Frères” at three-and-six!</P>\r\n<P>“In fact,” said Mr. Huttle, “a man is little less than a murderer who \r\ndoes.&nbsp; That is the province of the milksop, who wastes his evening at home \r\nplaying dominoes with his wife.&nbsp; I’ve heard of these people.&nbsp; We don’t \r\nwant them at this table.&nbsp; Our party is well selected.&nbsp; We’ve no use \r\nfor deaf old women, who cannot follow intellectual conversation.”</P>\r\n<P>All our eyes were turned to Mrs. Field, who fortunately, being deaf, did not \r\nhear his remarks; but continued smiling approval.</P>\r\n<P>“We have no representative at Mr. Franching’s table,” said Mr. Huttle, “of \r\nthe unenlightened frivolous matron, who goes to a second class dance at \r\nBayswater and fancies she is in Society.&nbsp; Society does not know her; it has \r\nno use for her.”</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Huttle paused for a moment and the opportunity was afforded for the \r\nladies to rise.&nbsp; I asked Mr. Franching quietly to excuse me, as I did not \r\nwish to miss the last train, which we very nearly did, by-the-by, through Carrie \r\nhaving mislaid the little cloth cricket-cap which she wears when we go out.</P>\r\n<P>It was very late when Carrie and I got home; but on entering the sitting-room \r\nI said: “Carrie, what do you think of Mr. Hardfur Huttle?”&nbsp; She simply \r\nanswered: “How like Lupin!”&nbsp; The same idea occurred to me in the \r\ntrain.&nbsp; The comparison kept me awake half the night.&nbsp; Mr. Huttle was, \r\nof course, an older and more influential man; but he <I>was</I> like Lupin, and \r\nit made me think how dangerous Lupin would be if he were older and more \r\ninfluential.&nbsp; I feel proud to think Lupin <I>does</I> resemble Mr. Huttle \r\nin some ways.&nbsp; Lupin, like Mr. Huttle, has original and sometimes wonderful \r\nideas; but it is those ideas that are so dangerous.&nbsp; They make men \r\nextremely rich or extremely poor.&nbsp; They make or break men.&nbsp; I always \r\nfeel people are happier who live a simple unsophisticated life.&nbsp; I believe \r\n<I>I</I> am happy because I am not ambitious.&nbsp; Somehow I feel that Lupin, \r\nsince he has been with Mr. Perkupp, has become content to settle down and follow \r\nthe footsteps of his father.&nbsp; This is a comfort.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter XXI</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Lupin is discharged.&nbsp;

and I scarcely know how I am writing my \r\ndiary.&nbsp; I was away from office last Sat., the first time I have been absent \r\nthrough illness for twenty years.&nbsp; I believe I was poisoned by some \r\nlobster.&nbsp; Mr. Perkupp was also absent, as Fate would have it; and our most \r\nvalued customer, Mr. Crowbillon, went to the office in a rage, and withdrew his \r\ncustom.&nbsp; My boy Lupin not only had the assurance to receive him, but \r\nrecommended him the firm of Gylterson, Sons and Co. Limited.&nbsp; In my own \r\nhumble judgment, and though I have to say it against my own son, this seems an \r\nact of treachery.</P>\r\n<P>This morning I receive a letter from Perkupp, informing me that Lupin’s \r\nservices are no longer required, and an interview with me is desired at eleven \r\no’clock.&nbsp; I went down to the office with an aching heart, dreading an \r\ninterview with Mr. Perkupp, with whom I have never had a word.&nbsp; I saw \r\nnothing of Lupin in the morning.&nbsp; He had not got up when it was time for me \r\nto leave, and Carrie said I should do no good by disturbing him.&nbsp; My mind \r\nwandered so at the office that I could not do my work properly.</P>\r\n<P>As I expected, I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, and the following conversation \r\nensued as nearly as I can remember it.</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Perkupp said: “Good-morning, Mr. Pooter!&nbsp; This is a very serious \r\nbusiness.&nbsp; I am not referring so much to the dismissal of your son, for I \r\nknew we should have to part sooner or later.&nbsp; <I>I</I> am the head of this \r\nold, influential, and much-respected firm; and when <I>I</I> consider the time \r\nhas come to revolutionise the business, <I>I</I> will do it myself.”</P>\r\n<P>I could see my good master was somewhat affected, and I said: “I hope, sir, \r\nyou do not imagine that I have in any way countenanced my son’s unwarrantable \r\ninterference?”&nbsp; Mr. Perkupp rose from his seat and took my hand, and said: \r\n“Mr. Pooter, I would as soon suspect myself as suspect you.”&nbsp; I was so \r\nagitated that in the confusion, to show my gratitude I very nearly called him a \r\n“grand old man.”</P>\r\n<P>Fortunately I checked myself in time, and said he was a “grand old \r\nmaster.”&nbsp; I was so unaccountable for my actions that I sat down, leaving \r\nhim standing.&nbsp; Of course, I at once rose, but Mr. Perkupp bade me sit down, \r\nwhich I was very pleased to do.&nbsp; Mr. Perkupp, resuming, said: “You will \r\nunderstand, Mr. Pooter, that the high-standing nature of our firm will not admit \r\nof our bending to anybody.&nbsp; If Mr. Crowbillon chooses to put his work into \r\nother hands—I may add, less experienced hands—it is not for us to bend and beg \r\nback his custom.”&nbsp; “You <I>shall</I> not do it, sir,” I said with \r\nindignation.&nbsp; “Exactly,” replied Mr. Perkupp; “I shall <I>not</I> do \r\nit.&nbsp; But I was thinking this, Mr. Pooter.&nbsp; Mr. Crowbillon is our most \r\nvalued client, and I will even confess—for I know this will not go beyond \r\nourselves—that we cannot afford very well to lose him, especially in these \r\ntimes, which are not of the brightest.&nbsp; Now, I fancy you can be of \r\nservice.”</P>\r\n<P>I replied: “Mr. Perkupp, I will work day and night to serve you!”</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Perkupp said: “I know you will.&nbsp; Now, what I should like you to do \r\nis this.&nbsp; You yourself might write to Mr. Crowbillon—you must not, of \r\ncourse, lead him to suppose I know anything about your doing so—and explain to \r\nhim that your son was only taken on as a clerk—quite an inexperienced one in \r\nfact—out of the respect the firm had for you, Mr. Pooter.&nbsp; This is, of \r\ncourse, a fact.&nbsp; I don’t suggest that you should speak in too strong terms \r\nof your own son’s conduct; but I may add, that had he been a son of mine, I \r\nshould have condemned his interference with no measured terms.&nbsp; That I \r\nleave to you.&nbsp; I think the result will be that Mr. Crowbillon will see the \r\nforce of the foolish step he has taken, and our firm will neither suffer in \r\ndignity nor in pocket.”</P>\r\n<P>I could not help thinking what a noble gentleman Mr. Perkupp is.&nbsp; His \r\nmanners and his way of speaking seem to almost thrill one with respect.</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Would you like to see the letter before I send it?”</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Perkupp said: “Oh no!&nbsp; I had better not.&nbsp; I am supposed to know \r\nnothing about it, and I have every confidence in you.&nbsp; You must write the \r\nletter carefully.&nbsp; We are not very busy; you had better take the morning \r\nto-morrow, or the whole day if you like.&nbsp; I shall be here myself all day \r\nto-morrow, in fact all the week, in case Mr. Crowbillon should call.”</P>\r\n<P>I went home a little more cheerful, but I left word with Sarah that I could \r\nnot see either Gowing or Cummings, nor in fact anybody, if they called in the \r\nevening.&nbsp; Lupin came into the parlour for a moment with a new hat on, and \r\nasked my opinion of it.&nbsp; I said I was not in the mood to judge of hats, and \r\nI did not think he was in a position to buy a new one.&nbsp; Lupin replied \r\ncarelessly: “I didn’t buy it; it was a present.”</P>\r\n<P>I have such terrible suspicions of Lupin now that I scarcely like to ask him \r\nquestions, as I dread the answers so.&nbsp; He, however, saved me the \r\ntrouble.</P>\r\n<P>He said: “I met a friend, an old friend, that I did not quite think a friend \r\nat the time; but it’s all right.&nbsp; As he wisely said, ‘all is fair in love \r\nand war,’ and there was no reason why we should not be friends still.&nbsp; He’s \r\na jolly, good, all-round sort of fellow, and a very different stamp from that \r\ninflated fool of a Perkupp.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Hush, Lupin!&nbsp; Do not pray add insult to injury.”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “What do you mean by injury?&nbsp; I repeat, I have done no \r\ninjury.&nbsp; Crowbillon is simply tired of a stagnant stick-in-the-mud firm, \r\nand made the change on his own account.&nbsp; I simply recommended the new firm \r\nas a matter of biz—good old biz!”</P>\r\n<P>I said quietly: “I don’t understand your slang, and at my time of life have \r\nno desire to learn it; so, Lupin, my boy, let us change the subject.&nbsp; I \r\nwill, if it please you, <I>try</I> and be interested in your new hat \r\nadventure.”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “Oh! there’s nothing much about it, except I have not once seen \r\nhim since his marriage, and he said he was very pleased to see me, and hoped we \r\nshould be friends.&nbsp; I stood a drink to cement the friendship, and he stood \r\nme a new hat—one of his own.”</P>\r\n<P>I said rather wearily: “But you have not told me your old friend’s name?”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said, with affected carelessness: “Oh didn’t I?&nbsp; Well, I \r\nwill.&nbsp; It was <I>Murray Posh</I>.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>May</SPAN> 14<P class=check>Lupin came down late, and seeing me at home \r\nall the morning, asked the reason of it.&nbsp; Carrie and I both agreed it was \r\nbetter to say nothing to him about the letter I was writing, so I evaded the \r\nquestion.</P>\r\n<P>Lupin went out, saying he was going to lunch with Murray Posh in the \r\nCity.&nbsp; I said I hoped Mr. Posh would provide him with a berth.&nbsp; Lupin \r\nwent out laughing, saying: “I don’t mind <I>wearing</I> Posh’s one-priced hats, \r\nbut I am not going to <I>sell</I> them.”&nbsp; Poor boy, I fear he is perfectly \r\nhopeless.</P>\r\n<P>It took me nearly the whole day to write to Mr. Crowbillon.&nbsp; Once or \r\ntwice I asked Carrie for suggestions; and although it seems ungrateful, her \r\nsuggestions were none of them to the point, while one or two were absolutely \r\nidiotic.&nbsp; Of course I did not tell her so.&nbsp; I got the letter off, and \r\ntook it down to the office for Mr. Perkupp to see, but he again repeated that he \r\ncould trust me.</P>\r\n<P>Gowing called in the evening, and I was obliged to tell him about Lupin and \r\nMr. Perkupp; and, to my surprise, he was quite inclined to side with \r\nLupin.&nbsp; Carrie joined in, and said she thought I was taking much too \r\nmelancholy a view of it.&nbsp; Gowing produced a pint sample-bottle of Madeira, \r\nwhich had been given him, which he said would get rid of the blues.&nbsp; I dare \r\nsay it would have done so if there had been more of it; but as Gowing helped \r\nhimself to three glasses, it did not leave much for Carrie and me to get rid of \r\nthe blues with.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>May</SPAN> 15<P class=check>A day of great anxiety, for I expected every \r\nmoment a letter from Mr. Crowbillon.&nbsp; Two letters came in the evening—one \r\nfor me, with “Crowbillon Hall” printed in large gold-and-red letters on the back \r\nof the envelope; the other for Lupin, which I felt inclined to open and read, as \r\nit had “Gylterson, Sons, and Co. Limited,” which was the recommended firm.&nbsp; \r\nI trembled as I opened Mr. Crowbillon’s letter.&nbsp; I wrote him sixteen pages, \r\nclosely written; he wrote me less than sixteen lines.</P>\r\n<P>His letter was: “Sir,—I totally disagree with you.&nbsp; Your son, in the \r\ncourse of five minutes’ conversation, displayed more intelligence than your firm \r\nhas done during the last five years.—Yours faithfully, Gilbert E. Gillam O. \r\nCrowbillon.”</P>\r\n<P>What am I to do?&nbsp; Here is a letter that I dare not show to Mr. Perkupp, \r\nand would not show to Lupin for anything.&nbsp; The crisis had yet to come; for \r\nLupin arrived, and, opening his letter, showed a cheque for £25 as a commission \r\nfor the recommendation of Mr. Crowbillon, whose custom to Mr. Perkupp is \r\nevidently lost for ever.&nbsp; Cummings and Gowing both called, and both took \r\nLupin’s part.&nbsp; Cummings went so far as to say that Lupin would make a name \r\nyet.&nbsp; I suppose I was melancholy, for I could only ask: “Yes, but what sort \r\nof a name?”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>May</SPAN> 16<P class=check>I told Mr. Perkupp the contents of the \r\nletter in a modified form, but Mr. Perkupp said: “Pray don’t discuss the matter; \r\nit is at an end.&nbsp; Your son will bring his punishment upon himself.”&nbsp; I \r\nwent home in the evening, thinking of the hopeless future of Lupin.&nbsp; I \r\nfound him in most extravagant spirits and in evening dress.&nbsp; He threw a \r\nletter on the table for me to read.</P>\r\n<P>To my amazement, I read that Gylterson and Sons had absolutely engaged Lupin \r\nat a salary of £200 a year, with other advantages.&nbsp; I read the letter \r\nthrough three times and thought it must have been for me.&nbsp; But there it \r\nwas—Lupin Pooter—plain enough.&nbsp; I was silent.&nbsp; Lupin said: “What price \r\nPerkupp now?&nbsp; You take my tip, Guv.—‘off’ with Perkupp and freeze on to \r\nGylterson, the firm of the future!&nbsp; Perkupp’s firm?&nbsp; The stagnant \r\ndummies have been standing still for years, and now are moving back.&nbsp; I \r\nwant to go on.&nbsp; In fact I must go <I>off</I>, as I am dining with the \r\nMurray Poshs to-night.”</P>\r\n<P>In the exuberance of his spirits he hit his hat with his stick, gave a loud \r\nwar “Whoo-oop,” jumped over a chair, and took the liberty of rumpling my hair \r\nall over my forehead, and bounced out of the room, giving me no chance of \r\nreminding him of his age and the respect which was due to his parent.&nbsp; \r\nGowing and Cummings came in the evening, and positively cheered me up with \r\ncongratulations respecting Lupin.</P>\r\n<P>Gowing said: “I always said he would get on, and, take my word, he has more \r\nin his head than we three put together.”</P>\r\n<P>Carrie said: “He is a second Hardfur Huttle.”</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter XXII</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Master Percy Edgar Smith James.&nbsp;

I had no appetite, having dined \r\nwell at two, and the entire evening was spoiled by little Percy—their only \r\nson—who seems to me to be an utterly spoiled child.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=75% src="22_1.gif"><br>Master Percy Edgar Smith Jones.</P>\r\n<P>Two or three times he came up to me and deliberately kicked my shins.&nbsp; \r\nHe hurt me once so much that the tears came into my eyes.&nbsp; I gently \r\nremonstrated with him, and Mrs. James said: “Please don’t scold him; I do not \r\nbelieve in being too severe with young children.&nbsp; You spoil their \r\ncharacter.”</P>\r\n<P>Little Percy set up a deafening yell here, and when Carrie tried to pacify \r\nhim, he slapped her face.</P>\r\n<P>I was so annoyed, I said: “That is not my idea of bringing up children, Mrs. \r\nJames.”</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James said.&nbsp; “People have different ideas of bringing up \r\nchildren—even your son Lupin is not the standard of perfection.”</P>\r\n<P>A Mr. Mezzini (an Italian, I fancy) here took Percy in his lap.&nbsp; The \r\nchild wriggled and kicked and broke away from Mr. Mezzini, saying: “I don’t like \r\nyou—you’ve got a dirty face.”</P>\r\n<P>A very nice gentleman, Mr. Birks Spooner, took the child by the wrist and \r\nsaid: “Come here, dear, and listen to this.”</P>\r\n<P>He detached his chronometer from the chain and made his watch strike six.</P>\r\n<P>To our horror, the child snatched it from his hand and bounced it down upon \r\nthe ground like one would a ball.</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Birks Spooner was most amiable, and said he could easily get a new glass \r\nput in, and did not suppose the works were damaged.</P>\r\n<P>To show you how people’s opinions differ, Carrie said the child was \r\nbad-tempered, but it made up for that defect by its looks, for it was—in her \r\nmind—an unquestionably beautiful child.</P>\r\n<P>I may be wrong, but I do not think I have seen a much uglier child \r\nmyself.&nbsp; That is <I>my</I> opinion.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>May</SPAN> 30<P class=check>I don’t know why it is, but I never \r\nanticipate with any pleasure the visits to our house of Mrs. James, of \r\nSutton.&nbsp; She is coming again to stay for a few days.&nbsp; I said to Carrie \r\nthis morning, as I was leaving: “I wish, dear Carrie, I could like Mrs. James \r\nbetter than I do.”</P>\r\n<P>Carrie said: “So do I, dear; but as for years I have had to put up with Mr. \r\nGowing, who is vulgar, and Mr. Cummings, who is kind but most uninteresting, I \r\nam sure, dear, you won’t mind the occasional visits of Mrs. James, who has more \r\nintellect in her little finger than both your friends have in their entire \r\nbodies.”</P>\r\n<P>I was so entirely taken back by this onslaught on my two dear old friends, I \r\ncould say nothing, and as I heard the ’bus coming, I left with a hurried kiss—a \r\nlittle too hurried, perhaps, for my upper lip came in contact with Carrie’s \r\nteeth and slightly cut it.&nbsp; It was quite painful for an hour \r\nafterwards.&nbsp; When I came home in the evening I found Carrie buried in a \r\nbook on Spiritualism, called <I>There is no Birth</I>, by Florence \r\nSingleyet.&nbsp; I need scarcely say the book was sent her to read by Mrs. \r\nJames, of Sutton.&nbsp; As she had not a word to say outside her book, I spent \r\nthe rest of the evening altering the stair-carpets, which are beginning to show \r\nsigns of wear at the edges.</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James arrived and, as usual, in the evening took the entire management \r\nof everything.&nbsp; Finding that she and Carrie were making some preparations \r\nfor table-turning, I thought it time really to put my foot down.&nbsp; I have \r\nalways had the greatest contempt for such nonsense, and put an end to it years \r\nago when Carrie, at our old house, used to have séances every night with poor \r\nMrs. Fussters (who is now dead).&nbsp; If I could see any use in it, I would not \r\ncare.&nbsp; As I stopped it in the days gone by, I determined to do so now.</P>\r\n<P>I said: “I am very sorry Mrs. James, but I totally disapprove of it, apart \r\nfrom the fact that I receive my old friends on this evening.”</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James said: “Do you mean to say you haven’t read <I>There is no \r\nBirth</I>?”&nbsp; I said: “No, and I have no intention of doing so.”&nbsp; Mrs. \r\nJames seemed surprised and said: “All the world is going mad over the \r\nbook.”&nbsp; I responded rather cleverly: “Let it.&nbsp; There will be one sane \r\nman in it, at all events.”</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James said she thought it was very unkind, and if people were all as \r\nprejudiced as I was, there would never have been the electric telegraph or the \r\ntelephone.</P>\r\n<P>I said that was quite a different thing.</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James said sharply: “In what way, pray—in what way?”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “In many ways.”</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James said: “Well, mention <I>one</I> way.”</P>\r\n<P>I replied quietly: “Pardon me, Mrs. James; I decline to discuss the \r\nmatter.&nbsp; I am not interested in it.”</P>\r\n<P>Sarah at this moment opened the door and showed in Cummings, for which I was \r\nthankful, for I felt it would put a stop to this foolish table-turning.&nbsp; \r\nBut I was entirely mistaken; for, on the subject being opened again, Cummings \r\nsaid he was most interested in Spiritualism, although he was bound to confess he \r\ndid not believe much in it; still, he was willing to be convinced.</P>\r\n<P>I firmly declined to take any part in it, with the result that my presence \r\nwas ignored.&nbsp; I left the three sitting in the parlour at a small round \r\ntable which they had taken out of the drawing-room.&nbsp; I walked into the hall \r\nwith the ultimate intention of taking a little stroll.&nbsp; As I opened the \r\ndoor, who should come in but Gowing!</P>\r\n<P>On hearing what was going on, he proposed that we should join the circle and \r\nhe would go into a trance.&nbsp; He added that he <I>knew</I> a few things about \r\nold Cummings, and would <I>invent</I> a few about Mrs. James.&nbsp; Knowing how \r\ndangerous Gowing is, I declined to let him take part in any such foolish \r\nperformance.&nbsp; Sarah asked me if she could go out for half an hour, and I \r\ngave her permission, thinking it would be more comfortable to sit with Gowing in \r\nthe kitchen than in the cold drawing-room.&nbsp; We talked a good deal about \r\nLupin and Mr. and Mrs. Murray Posh, with whom he is as usual spending the \r\nevening.&nbsp; Gowing said: “I say, it wouldn’t be a bad thing for Lupin if old \r\nPosh kicked the bucket.”</P>\r\n<P>My heart gave a leap of horror, and I rebuked Gowing very sternly for joking \r\non such a subject.&nbsp; I lay awake half the night thinking of it—the other \r\nhalf was spent in nightmares on the same subject.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>May</SPAN> 31<P class=check>I wrote a stern letter to the \r\nlaundress.&nbsp; I was rather pleased with the letter, for I thought it very \r\nsatirical.&nbsp; I said: “You have returned the handkerchiefs without the \r\ncolour.&nbsp; Perhaps you will return either the colour or the value of the \r\nhandkerchiefs.”&nbsp; I shall be rather curious to know what she will have to \r\nsay.</P>\r\n<P>More table-turning in the evening.&nbsp; Carrie said last night was in a \r\nmeasure successful, and they ought to sit again.&nbsp; Cummings came in, and \r\nseemed interested.&nbsp; I had the gas lighted in the drawing-room, got the \r\nsteps, and repaired the cornice, which has been a bit of an eyesore to me.&nbsp; \r\nIn a fit of unthinkingness—if I may use such an expression,—I gave the floor \r\nover the parlour, where the séance was taking place, two loud raps with the \r\nhammer.&nbsp; I felt sorry afterwards, for it was the sort of ridiculous, \r\nfoolhardy thing that Gowing or Lupin would have done.</P>\r\n<P>However, they never even referred to it, but Carrie declared that a message \r\ncame through the table to her of a wonderful description, concerning someone \r\nwhom she and I knew years ago, and who was quite unknown to the others.</P>\r\n<P>When we went to bed, Carrie asked me as a favour to sit to-morrow night, to \r\noblige her.&nbsp; She said it seemed rather unkind and unsociable on my \r\npart.&nbsp; I promised I would sit once.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>June</SPAN> 1<P class=check>I sat reluctantly at the table in the \r\nevening, and I am bound to admit some curious things happened.&nbsp; I contend \r\nthey were coincidences, but they were curious.&nbsp; For instance, the table \r\nkept tilting towards me, which Carrie construed as a desire that I should ask \r\nthe spirit a question.&nbsp; I obeyed the rules, and I asked the spirit (who \r\nsaid her name was Lina) if she could tell me the name of an old aunt of whom I \r\nwas thinking, and whom we used to call Aunt Maggie.&nbsp; The table spelled out \r\nC A T.&nbsp; We could make nothing out of it, till I suddenly remembered that \r\nher second name was Catherine, which it was evidently trying to spell.&nbsp; I \r\ndon’t think even Carrie knew this.&nbsp; But if she did, she would never \r\ncheat.&nbsp; I must admit it was curious.&nbsp; Several other things happened, \r\nand I consented to sit at another séance on Monday.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>June</SPAN> 3<P class=check>The laundress called, and said she was very \r\nsorry about the handkerchiefs, and returned ninepence.&nbsp; I said, as the \r\ncolour was completely washed out and the handkerchiefs quite spoiled, ninepence \r\nwas not enough.&nbsp; Carrie replied that the two handkerchiefs originally only \r\ncost sixpence, for she remembered bring them at a sale at the Holloway <I>Bon \r\nMarché</I>.&nbsp; In that case, I insisted that threepence buying should be \r\nreturned to the laundress.&nbsp; Lupin has gone to stay with the Poshs for a few \r\ndays.&nbsp; I must say I feel very uncomfortable about it.&nbsp; Carrie said I \r\nwas ridiculous to worry about it.&nbsp; Mr. Posh was very fond of Lupin, who, \r\nafter all, was only a mere boy.</P>\r\n<P>In the evening we had another séance, which, in some respects, was very \r\nremarkable, although the first part of it was a little doubtful.&nbsp; Gowing \r\ncalled, as well as Cummings, and begged to be allowed to join the circle.&nbsp; \r\nI wanted to object, but Mrs. James, who appears a good Medium (that is, if there \r\nis anything in it at all), thought there might be a little more spirit power if \r\nGowing joined; so the five of us sat down.</P>\r\n<P>The moment I turned out the gas, and almost before I could get my hands on \r\nthe table, it rocked violently and tilted, and began moving quickly across the \r\nroom.&nbsp; Gowing shouted out: “Way oh! steady, lad, steady!”&nbsp; I told \r\nGowing if he could not behave himself I should light the gas, and put an end to \r\nthe séance.</P>\r\n<P>To tell the truth, I thought Gowing was playing tricks, and I hinted as much; \r\nbut Mrs. James said she had often seen the table go right off the ground.&nbsp; \r\nThe spirit Lina came again, and said, “WARN” three or four times, and declined \r\nto explain.&nbsp; Mrs. James said “Lina” was stubborn sometimes.&nbsp; She often \r\nbehaved like that, and the best thing to do was to send her away.</P>\r\n<P>She then hit the table sharply, and said: “Go away, Lina; you are \r\ndisagreeable.&nbsp; Go away!”&nbsp; I should think we sat nearly three-quarters \r\nof an hour with nothing happening.&nbsp; My hands felt quite cold, and I \r\nsuggested we should stop the séance.&nbsp; Carrie and Mrs. James, as well as \r\nCummings, would not agree to it.&nbsp; In about ten minutes’ time there was some \r\ntilting towards me.&nbsp; I gave the alphabet, and it spelled out S P O O \r\nF.&nbsp; As I have heard both Gowing and Lupin use the word, and as I could hear \r\nGowing silently laughing, I directly accused him of pushing the table.&nbsp; He \r\ndenied it; but, I regret to say, I did not believe him.</P>\r\n<P>Gowing said: “Perhaps it means ‘Spook,’ a ghost.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “<I>You</I> know it doesn’t mean anything of the sort.”</P>\r\n<P>Gowing said: “Oh! very well—I’m sorry I ‘spook,’” and he rose from the \r\ntable.</P>\r\n<P>No one took any notice of the stupid joke, and Mrs. James suggested he should \r\nsit out for a while.&nbsp; Gowing consented and sat in the arm-chair.</P>\r\n<P>The table began to move again, and we might have had a wonderful séance but \r\nfor Gowing’s stupid interruptions.&nbsp; In answer to the alphabet from Carrie \r\nthe table spelt “NIPUL,” then the “WARN” three times.&nbsp; We could not think \r\nwhat it meant till Cummings pointed out that “NIPUL” was Lupin spelled \r\nbackwards.&nbsp; This was quite exciting.&nbsp; Carrie was particularly excited, \r\nand said she hoped nothing horrible was going to happen.</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James asked if “Lina” was the spirit.&nbsp; The table replied firmly, \r\n“No,” and the spirit would not give his or her name.&nbsp; We then had the \r\nmessage, “NIPUL will be very rich.”</P>\r\n<P>Carrie said she felt quite relieved, but the word “WARN” was again spelt \r\nout.&nbsp; The table then began to oscillate violently, and in reply to Mrs. \r\nJames, who spoke very softly to the table, the spirit began to spell its \r\nname.&nbsp; It first spelled “DRINK.”</P>\r\n<P>Gowing here said: “Ah! that’s more in my line.”</P>\r\n<P>I asked him to be quiet as the name might not be completed.</P>\r\n<P>The table then spelt “WATER.”</P>\r\n<P>Gowing here interrupted again, and said: “Ah! that’s <I>not</I> in my \r\nline.&nbsp; <I>Outside</I> if you like, but not inside.”</P>\r\n<P>Carrie appealed to him to be quiet.</P>\r\n<P>The table then spelt “CAPTAIN,” and Mrs. James startled us by crying out, \r\n“Captain Drinkwater, a very old friend of my father’s, who has been dead some \r\nyears.”</P>\r\n<P>This was more interesting, and I could not help thinking that after all there \r\nmust be something in Spiritualism.</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James asked the spirit to interpret the meaning of the word “Warn” as \r\napplied to “NIPUL.”&nbsp; The alphabet was given again, and we got the word \r\n“BOSH.”</P>\r\n<P>Gowing here muttered: “So it is.”</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James said she did not think the spirit meant that, as Captain \r\nDrinkwater was a perfect gentleman, and would never have used the word in answer \r\nto a lady’s question.&nbsp; Accordingly the alphabet was given again.</P>\r\n<P>This time the table spelled distinctly “POSH.”&nbsp; We all thought of Mrs. \r\nMurray Posh and Lupin.&nbsp; Carrie was getting a little distressed, and as it \r\nwas getting late we broke up the circle.</P>\r\n<P>We arranged to have one more to-morrow, as it will be Mrs. James’ last night \r\nin town.&nbsp; We also determined <I>not</I> to have Gowing present.</P>\r\n<P>Cummings, before leaving, said it was certainly interesting, but he wished \r\nthe spirits would say something about him.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>June</SPAN> 4<P class=check>Quite looking forward to the séance this \r\nevening.&nbsp; Was thinking of it all the day at the office.</P>\r\n<P>Just as we sat down at the table we were annoyed by Gowing entering without \r\nknocking.</P>\r\n<P>He said: “I am not going to stop, but I have brought with me a sealed \r\nenvelope, which I know I can trust with Mrs. Pooter.&nbsp; In that sealed \r\nenvelope is a strip of paper on which I have asked a simple question.&nbsp; If \r\nthe spirits can answer that question, I will believe in Spiritualism.”</P>\r\n<P>I ventured the expression that it might be impossible.</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James said: “Oh no! it is of common occurrence for the spirits to answer \r\nquestions under such conditions—and even for them to write on locked \r\nslates.&nbsp; It is quite worth trying.&nbsp; If ‘Lina’ is in a good temper, she \r\nis certain to do it.”</P>\r\n<P>Gowing said: “All right; then I shall be a firm believer.&nbsp; I shall \r\nperhaps drop in about half-past nine or ten, and hear the result.”</P>\r\n<P>He then left and we sat a long time.&nbsp; Cummings wanted to know something \r\nabout some undertaking in which he was concerned, but he could get no answer of \r\nany description whatever—at which he said he was very disappointed and was \r\nafraid there was not much in table-turning after all.&nbsp; I thought this \r\nrather selfish of him.&nbsp; The séance was very similar to the one last night, \r\nalmost the same in fact.&nbsp; So we turned to the letter.&nbsp; “Lina” took a \r\nlong time answering the question, but eventually spelt out “ROSES, LILIES, AND \r\nCOWS.”&nbsp; There was great rocking of the table at this time, and Mrs. James \r\nsaid: “If that is Captain Drinkwater, let us ask him the answer as well?”</P>\r\n<P>It was the spirit of the Captain, and, most singular, he gave the same \r\nidentical answer: “ROSES, LILIES, AND COWS.”</P>\r\n<P>I cannot describe the agitation with which Carrie broke the seal, or the \r\ndisappointment we felt on reading the question, to which the answer was so \r\ninappropriate.&nbsp; The question was, “<I>What’s old Pooter’s age</I>?”</P>\r\n<P>This quite decided me.</P>\r\n<P>As I had put my foot down on Spiritualism years ago, so I would again.</P>\r\n<P>I am pretty easy-going as a rule, but I can be extremely firm when driven to \r\nit.</P>\r\n<P>I said slowly, as I turned up the gas: “This is the last of this nonsense \r\nthat shall ever take place under my roof.&nbsp; I regret I permitted myself to \r\nbe a party to such tomfoolery.&nbsp; If there is anything in it—which I doubt—it \r\nis nothing of any good, and I <I>won’t have it again</I>.&nbsp; That is \r\nenough.”</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James said: “I think, Mr. Pooter, you are rather over-stepping—”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “Hush, madam.&nbsp; I am master of this house—please understand \r\nthat.”</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. James made an observation which I sincerely hope I was mistaken \r\nin.&nbsp; I was in such a rage I could not quite catch what she said.&nbsp; But \r\nif I thought she said what it sounded like, she should never enter the house \r\nagain.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter XXIII</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>Lupin leaves us.&nbsp; We dine at his new apartments, and hear some extraordinary information respecting the wealth of Mr. Murray Posh.&nbsp; Meet Miss Lilian Posh.&nbsp; Am sent for by Mr. Hardfur Huttle.&nbsp; Important.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>July</SPAN> 1<P class=check>I find, on looking over my diary, nothing of \r\nany consequence has taken place during the last month.&nbsp; To-day we lose \r\nLupin, who has taken furnished apartments at Bayswater, near his friends, Mr. \r\nand Mrs. Murray Posh, at two guineas a week.&nbsp; I think this is most \r\nextravagant of him, as it is half his salary.&nbsp; Lupin says one never loses \r\nby a good address, and, to use his own expression, Brickfield Terrace is a bit \r\n“off.”&nbsp; Whether he means it is “far off” I do not know.&nbsp; I have long \r\nsince given up trying to understand his curious expressions.&nbsp; I said the \r\nneighbourhood had always been good enough for his parents.&nbsp; His reply was: \r\n“It is no question of being good or bad.&nbsp; There is no money in it, and I am \r\nnot going to rot away my life in the suburbs.”</P>\r\n<P>We are sorry to lose him, but perhaps he will get on better by himself, and \r\nthere may be some truth in his remark that an old and a young horse can’t pull \r\ntogether in the same cart.</P>\r\n<P>Gowing called, and said that the house seemed quite peaceful, and like old \r\ntimes.&nbsp; He liked Master Lupin very well, but he occasionally suffered from \r\nwhat he could not help—youth.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>July</SPAN> 2<P class=check>Cummings called, looked very pale, and said \r\nhe had been very ill again, and of course not a single friend had been near \r\nhim.&nbsp; Carrie said she had never heard of it, whereupon he threw down a copy \r\nof the <I>Bicycle News</I> on the table, with the following paragraph: “We \r\nregret to hear that that favourite old roadster, Mr. Cummings (‘Long’ Cummings), \r\nhas met with what might have been a serious accident in Rye Lane.&nbsp; A \r\nmischievous boy threw a stick between the spokes of one of the back wheels, and \r\nthe machine overturned, bringing our brother tricyclist heavily to the \r\nground.&nbsp; Fortunately he was more frightened than hurt, but we missed his \r\nmerry face at the dinner at Chingford, where they turned up in good \r\nnumbers.&nbsp; ‘Long’ Cummings’ health was proposed by our popular Vice, Mr. \r\nWestropp, the prince of bicyclists, who in his happiest vein said it was a case \r\nof ‘<I>Cumming</I>(s) thro’ the <I>Rye</I>, but fortunately there was more \r\n<I>wheel</I> than <I>woe</I>,’ a joke which created roars of laughter.”</P>\r\n<P>We all said we were very sorry, and pressed Cummings to stay to supper.&nbsp; \r\nCummings said it was like old times being without Lupin, and he was much better \r\naway.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>July</SPAN> 3<br>Sunday<P class=check>In the afternoon, as I was looking \r\nout of the parlour window, which was open, a grand trap, driven by a lady, with \r\na gentleman seated by the side of her, stopped at our door.&nbsp; Not wishing to \r\nbe seen, I withdrew my head very quickly, knocking the back of it violently \r\nagainst the sharp edge of the window-sash.&nbsp; I was nearly stunned.&nbsp; \r\nThere was a loud double-knock at the front door; Carrie rushed out of the \r\nparlour, upstairs to her room, and I followed, as Carrie thought it was Mr. \r\nPerkupp.&nbsp; I thought it was Mr. Franching<P class=check>I whispered to Sarah over the \r\nbanisters: “Show them into the drawing-room.”&nbsp; Sarah said, as the shutters \r\nwere not opened, the room would smell musty.&nbsp; There was another loud \r\nrat-tat.&nbsp; I whispered: “Then show them into the parlour, and say Mr. Pooter \r\nwill be down directly.”&nbsp; I changed my coat, but could not see to do my \r\nhair, as Carrie was occupying the glass.</P>\r\n<P>Sarah came up, and said it was Mrs. Murray Posh and Mr. Lupin.</P>\r\n<P>This was quite a relief.&nbsp; I went down with Carrie, and Lupin met me with \r\nthe remark: “I say, what did you run away from the window for?&nbsp; Did we \r\nfrighten you?”</P>\r\n<P>I foolishly said: “What window?”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “Oh, you know.&nbsp; Shut it.&nbsp; You looked as if you were \r\nplaying at Punch and Judy.”</P>\r\n<P>On Carrie asking if she could offer them anything, Lupin said: “Oh, I think \r\nDaisy will take on a cup of tea.&nbsp; I can do with a B. and S.”</P>\r\n<P>I said: “I am afraid we have no soda.”</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “Don’t bother about that.&nbsp; You just trip out and hold the \r\nhorse; I don’t think Sarah understands it.”</P>\r\n<P>They stayed a very short time, and as they were leaving, Lupin said: “I want \r\nyou both to come and dine with me next Wednesday, and see my new place.&nbsp; \r\nMr. and Mrs. Murray Posh, Miss Posh (Murray’s sister) are coming.&nbsp; Eight \r\no’clock sharp.&nbsp; No one else.”</P>\r\n<P>I said we did not pretend to be fashionable people, and would like the dinner \r\nearlier, as it made it so late before we got home.</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “Rats!&nbsp; You must get used to it.&nbsp; If it comes to that, \r\nDaisy and I can drive you home.”</P>\r\n<P>We promised to go; but I must say in my simple mind the familiar way in which \r\nMrs. Posh and Lupin addressed each other is reprehensible.&nbsp; Anybody would \r\nthink they had been children together.&nbsp; I certainly should object to a six \r\nmonths’ acquaintance calling <I>my</I> wife “Carrie,” and driving out with \r\nher.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>July</SPAN> 4<P class=check>Lupin’s rooms looked very nice; but the \r\ndinner was, I thought, a little too grand, especially as he commenced with \r\nchampagne straight off.&nbsp; I also think Lupin might have told us that he and \r\nMr. and Mrs. Murray Posh and Miss Posh were going to put on full evening \r\ndress.&nbsp; Knowing that the dinner was only for us six, we never dreamed it \r\nwould be a full dress affair.&nbsp; I had no appetite.&nbsp; It was quite twenty \r\nminutes past eight before we sat down to dinner.&nbsp; At six I could have eaten \r\na hearty meal.&nbsp; I had a bit of bread-and-butter at that hour, feeling \r\nfamished, and I expect that partly spoiled my appetite.</P>\r\n<P class=figure><img width=75% src="23_1.gif"><br>“Lillie Girl.”</P>\r\n<P>We were introduced to Miss Posh, whom Lupin called “Lillie Girl,” as if he \r\nhad known her all his life.&nbsp; She was very tall, rather plain, and I thought \r\nshe was a little painted round the eyes.&nbsp; I hope I am wrong; but she had \r\nsuch fair hair, and yet her eyebrows were black.&nbsp; She looked about \r\nthirty.&nbsp; I did not like the way she kept giggling and giving Lupin smacks \r\nand pinching him.&nbsp; Then her laugh was a sort of a scream that went right \r\nthrough my ears, all the more irritating because there was nothing to laugh \r\nat.&nbsp; In fact, Carrie and I were not at all prepossessed with her.&nbsp; \r\nThey all smoked cigarettes after dinner, including Miss Posh, who startled \r\nCarrie by saying: “Don’t you smoke, dear?”&nbsp; I answered for Carrie, and \r\nsaid: “Mrs. Charles Pooter has not arrived at it yet,” whereupon Miss Posh gave \r\none of her piercing laughs again.</P>\r\n<P>Mrs. Posh sang a dozen songs at least, and I can only repeat what I have said \r\nbefore—she does <I>not</I> sing in tune; but Lupin sat by the side of the piano, \r\ngazing into her eyes the whole time.&nbsp; If I had been Mr. Posh, I think I \r\nshould have had something to say about it.&nbsp; Mr. Posh made himself very \r\nagreeable to us, and eventually sent us home in his carriage, which I thought \r\nmost kind.&nbsp; He is evidently very rich, for Mrs. Posh had on some beautiful \r\njewellery.&nbsp; She told Carrie her necklace, which her husband gave her as a \r\nbirthday present, alone cost £300.</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Posh said he had a great belief in Lupin, and thought he would make rapid \r\nway in the world.</P>\r\n<P>I could not help thinking of the £600 Mr. Posh lost over the <I>Parachikka \r\nChlorates</I> through Lupin’s advice.</P>\r\n<P>During the evening I had an opportunity to speak to Lupin, and expressed a \r\nhope that Mr. Posh was not living beyond his means.</P>\r\n<P>Lupin sneered, and said Mr. Posh was worth thousands.&nbsp; “Posh’s one-price \r\nhat” was a household word in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and all the big \r\ntowns throughout England.&nbsp; Lupin further informed me that Mr. Posh was \r\nopening branch establishments at New York, Sydney, and Melbourne, and was \r\nnegotiating for Kimberley and Johannesburg.</P>\r\n<P>I said I was pleased to hear it.</P>\r\n<P>Lupin said: “Why, he has settled over £10,000 on Daisy, and the same amount \r\non ‘Lillie Girl.’&nbsp; If at any time I wanted a little capital, he would put \r\nup a couple of ‘thou’ at a day’s notice, and could buy up Perkupp’s firm over \r\nhis head at any moment with ready cash.”</P>\r\n<P>On the way home in the carriage, for the first time in my life, I was \r\ninclined to indulge in the radical thought that money was <I>not</I> properly \r\ndivided.</P>\r\n<P>On arriving home at a quarter-past eleven, we found a hansom cab, which had \r\nbeen waiting for me for two hours with a letter.&nbsp; Sarah said she did not \r\nknow what to do, as we had not left the address where we had gone.&nbsp; I \r\ntrembled as I opened the letter, fearing it was some bad news about Mr. \r\nPerkupp.&nbsp; The note was: “Dear Mr. Pooter,—Come down to the Victoria Hotel \r\nwithout delay.&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; Yours truly, Hardfur Huttle.”</P>\r\n<P>I asked the cabman if it was too late.&nbsp; The cabman replied that it was \r\n<I>not</I>; for his instructions were, if I happened to be out, he was to wait \r\ntill I came home.&nbsp; I felt very tired, and really wanted to go to bed.&nbsp; \r\nI reached the hotel at a quarter before midnight.&nbsp; I apologised for being \r\nso late, but Mr. Huttle said: “Not at all; come and have a few oysters.”&nbsp; I \r\nfeel my heart beating as I write these words.&nbsp; To be brief, Mr. Huttle said \r\nhe had a rich American friend who wanted to do something large in our line of \r\nbusiness, and that Mr. Franching had mentioned my name to him.&nbsp; We talked \r\nover the matter.&nbsp; If, by any happy chance, the result be successful, I can \r\nmore than compensate my dear master for the loss of Mr. Crowbillon’s \r\ncustom.&nbsp; Mr. Huttle had previously said: “The glorious ‘Fourth’ is a lucky \r\nday for America, and, as it has not yet struck twelve, we will celebrate it with \r\na glass of the best wine to be had in the place, and drink good luck to our bit \r\nof business.”</P>\r\n<P>I fervently hope it will bring good luck to us all.</P>\r\n<P>It was two o’clock when I got home.&nbsp; Although I was so tired, I could \r\nnot sleep except for short intervals—then only to dream.</P>\r\n<P>I kept dreaming of Mr. Perkupp and Mr. Huttle.&nbsp; The latter was in a \r\nlovely palace with a crown on.&nbsp; Mr. Perkupp was waiting in the room.&nbsp; \r\nMr. Huttle kept taking off this crown and handing it to me, and calling me \r\n“President.”</P>\r\n<P>He appeared to take no notice of Mr. Perkupp, and I kept asking Mr. Huttle to \r\ngive the crown to my worthy master.&nbsp; Mr. Huttle kept saying: “No, this is \r\nthe White House of Washington, and you must keep your crown, Mr. President.”</P>\r\n<P>We all laughed long and very loudly, till I got parched, and then I woke \r\nup.&nbsp; I fell asleep, only to dream the same thing over and over again.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<h2>Chapter the last</h2>\r\n<P class=chaptersummary>One of the happiest days of my life.</P>\r\n&lt;NP&gt;\r\n<P class=date><SPAN class=smcap>July</SPAN> 10<P class=check>The excitement and anxiety through which I \r\nhave gone the last few days have been almost enough to turn my hair grey.&nbsp;

Do you like your house, and are you happy where you are?”</P>\r\n<P>I replied: “Yes, sir; I love my house and I love the neighbourhood, and could \r\nnot bear to leave it.”</P>\r\n<P>Mr. Perkupp, to my surprise, said: “Mr. Pooter, I will purchase the freehold \r\nof that house, and present it to the most honest and most worthy man it has ever \r\nbeen my lot to meet.”</P>\r\n<P>He shook my hand, and said he hoped my wife and I would be spared many years \r\nto enjoy it.&nbsp; My heart was too full to thank him; and, seeing my \r\nembarrassment, the good fellow said: “You need say nothing, Mr. Pooter,” and \r\nleft the office.</P>\r\n<P>I sent telegrams to Carrie, Gowing, and Cummings (a thing I have never done \r\nbefore), and asked the two latter to come round to supper.</P>\r\n<P>On arriving home I found Carrie crying with joy, and I sent Sarah round to \r\nthe grocer’s to get two bottles of “Jackson Frères.”</P>\r\n<P>My two dear friends came in the evening, and the last post brought a letter \r\nfrom Lupin in reply to mine.&nbsp; I read it aloud to them all.&nbsp; It ran: \r\n“My dear old Guv.,—Keep your hair on.&nbsp; You are on the wrong tack \r\nagain.&nbsp; I am engaged to be married to ‘Lillie Girl.’&nbsp; I did not \r\nmention it last Thursday, as it was not definitely settled.&nbsp; We shall be \r\nmarried in August, and amongst our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing \r\nand Cummings.&nbsp; With much love to all, from <I>The same old Lupin</I>.”</P>\r\n'
